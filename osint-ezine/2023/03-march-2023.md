#### AI: Early experiments with GPT-4

A group of researchers have published a paper about GPT-4 just after its recent public release. The experts have been working and improving this new model for approximately six months and they have released this document, where they showcase some examples of its new functionalities:

#### News: Recognizing Sexual and Gender-Based Violence as an Open Source Researcher.

Bellingcat shared a detailed article to take into consideration in our investigations. The article presents some definitions such as what is sexual and gender-based violence, why it is relevant to investigators and how to identify it. It concludes with several resources to improve our knowledge in the area in order to provide better quality in our products:
