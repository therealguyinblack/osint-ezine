#### AI: Auto-GPT.

An experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous. The GPT-4 API is being used by dozens of projects in order to achieve two different goals, full access to the Internet and secondly bring autonomous capabilities to the model. This repo provides a proof of concept to achieve the latter:

#### Crypto: Smart Contract online explainer.

Easy and efficient, the kind of applications that I love. 'Contract Wizard' makes an easy resume about what a Smart Contract is about with merely the contract address. For the moment it covers Ethereum , Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism blockchains.

Withdrawals for validator nodes in Ethereum have been implemented this month as part of the Shanghai/Capella upgrade. As usual, one of the best resources to know more about it is the official Ethereum website:

#### News: Pause giant AI experiments: An open letter.

2023 is the year of AI (2022 was Metaverse, 2024 will be IoT...). More than 27000 individuals from very different background such as Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak or Yuval Noah Harari signed a petition to "_call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4._" As the topic is a great social debate, you can read and make your own opinion about the letter from the original source:
