### AI: Generative Artificial Intelligence.

Generative AI can supply criminals with a wide range of tools to enhance their illicit business models. This study by the Intellectual Property Crime Project looks at how criminals utilize generative AI to violate various intellectual property rights. It examines ongoing cases and attempts to regulate the use of generative AI use in the field of intellectual property.

### AI: _X_ Grok.

xAI, the Artificial Intelligence department of X (former Twitter) announced during this month their own chatbot, Grok. Another competitor in the LLM (Large Language Model) landscape that promises different features such as access to real-world content or that it is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!

### Crypto: TON Achieves 100.000 tps, World Record.

On October 31st, The Open Network (TON) blockchain achieved a remarkable milestone by processing a staggering 104,715 transactions per second (TPS) during its first performance public test, completing a total of 107,652,545 transactions within just 25 minutes. This accomplishment underscores the incredible potential of the TON network architecture, and it's truly a game-changer for the world of blockchain technology.

### Learning: Common Abuses on Mastodon.

Mastodon is the lead platform on the Fediverse. Decentralised and alternative social media platforms gained popularity this year, having Mastodon and BlueSky as the best representatives. Mastodon instances are moderated individually and this opens the door to a different variety of decisions by the administrators with regards the content hosted on them. In this post, Stanford's Internet Observatory describes some cases of common abuses on Mastodon.

### Learning: How an Unarmed Youth was Shot by the Nigerian Military.

Reuters and Bellingcat analysed rare video footage of a young detainee summarily slain by a military gunman on the day of a battle against insurgents in Nigeria's northeast. Three experts in international law deem the 2015 shooting a war crime. The U.S. State Department is calling for an investigation. Nigerian officials previously have denied committing abuses in the conflict. Disclaimer: the following link **contains disturbing photo and video content**.

### News: ProtonMail to Use Blockchain to Verify Recipient's Email Addresses.

ProtonMail is rolling out a new feature (currently in beta) called "Key Transparency" to verify the authenticity of a recipient's email address. This new feature is based on blockchain technology and it ensures that the information about the recipients (the key) is the real one without possibility of tampering, modification or deletion.

### Privacy: Debunking the Myth of “Anonymous” Data.

Sometimes companies say our personal data is “anonymized,” implying a one-way ratchet where it can never be dis-aggregated and re-identified. But this is not possible—anonymous data rarely stays this way. This post gives some insights about data anonymization and re-identification and shows some examples of how data can be reconstructed in order to identify users based on specific selectors such as postal code or gender.

### Privacy: Signal Testing Usernames to Replace Phone Numbers.

Signal is testing the displaying of Usernames instead of phone numbers to protect people’s privacy while using the popular end-to-end encrypted messenger app. In a similar fashion to other instant messaging applications, according to the information shared, you will still need a phone number to create an account on Signal but after that, other users would be able to contact you via username. The feature is still on development but it has been released on a beta stage that soon may be available for the rest of the users.

### Techniques: Google Searches Bad. What to do?

Lately I have delivered different OSINT trainings about "Search Engines Queries". Even if it is a basic skill that every OSINT investigator should master, some times we forget about certain operators or we are not accurate enough to obtain the results we want. In this article some tips and techniques are shared to improve and expand your OSINT skill set with regards online searches.

### Techniques: How to Verify Leak Data?

A leak data verification checklist for investigators. Data breaches are one of the main sources nowadays to obtain information in our investigations but, depending on the origin of them, we always need to check for its reliability. This post provides different examples on how to verify data coming from unknown sources or from unreliable origins.

### Tools: FaceChain, your Digital-Twin.

FaceChain is a deep-learning tool chain for generating your Digital-Twin. With a minimum of 1 portrait-photo, you can create a Digital-Twin of your own and start generating personal portraits in different settings (multiple styles now supported!). You may train your Digital-Twin model and generate photos via FaceChain's Python scripts, or webui. Very interesting for create profile pictures for investigative accounts or if you need an specific one for a social media post.

### Tools: Keywords Highlight.

This is a browser based bookmark that will ask for one or more keywords. The keywords will be searched for on the current webpage that you are visiting. If one or more of these keywords are found they will be highlighted. Each found keyword will have its own color for better overview.
