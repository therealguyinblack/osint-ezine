### AI: ChatGPT, a practical guide to combat disinformation and fake reviews.

The internet is being flooded with disinformation and fake reviews, generated by users of AI tools such as ChatGPT, with malicious intent. This report by ShadowDragon outlines how to identify AI-generated materials online that are intentionally spreading false information or even intended to incite violence.

### AI: Indirect prompt-injection attacks.

A website called "Bring Sydney Back" has revived a version of Microsoft's shut-down chatbot, Sydney, along with its peculiar behaviour. The site demonstrates how generative AI systems can be manipulated through external inputs. The creator used an indirect prompt-injection attack to create a replica of Sydney, feeding the AI system data from an outside source to make it behave in unintended ways. This highlights the potential dangers of such attacks against generative AI systems.

### AI: Massive surge in requests overwhelms Archive.org.

Archive.org experienced a major disruption as tens of thousands of requests per second flooded in for their public domain OCR files. What seemed to be an AI training crawler, coming from Amazon's AWS services, lead to a complete shutdown of the platform for approximately an hour. This unfair and sometimes, illegal behaviours, more close to DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, are on trend because the increasing development of new AI algorithms with high demand of training data.

### Crypto: New NFT functionalities for Ethereum.

The standard ERC-6551 was adopted early on May and it has a whole set of features that will improve the use cases for NFT tokens, specially DeFi (Decentralised Finance) and Gaming areas would benefit of it as it would allow NFTs to interact with contracts or to have their own accounts (Token Bound Accounts) within the same tokens.

### News: Discord usernames update.

Discord announced its username format migration. It will start the roll up with Nitro and subscription members and then, the rest of the users based on when they registered on the platform.

### News: Google and Twitter removing inactive accounts.

To protect users from security threats such as spam, phishing, scams or account hijacking, two of the major social media platforms have updated their terms of service to warn users about the imminent removal of inactive accounts. If you have followed my advice during any of my trainings, an investigative account or sock puppet must be always active and behave as "human" as possible, if is not your case, it's time to put measures in place before they are remove from the services. For Google services, they will remove accounts without being signed into for at least 2 years. In the case of Twitter, the inactivity period is reduced to 30 days.

### Privacy: Google Passkeys, a new way to sign in.

Google has enabled to Google Accounts "Passkeys", a new functionality to sign in to websites and services without the use of passwords. The idea behind is to replace cumbersome passwords with fingerprints, face scans or screen lock PINs. Even if the idea of make it easy the process of log in to different services, the fact that most of the mechanisms that would replace passwords are biometric data, brings into the spotlight new concerns about privacy and processing of biometric data.

### Privacy: Google .zip domains, a phishing paradise.

Earlier this month, Google began offering the ability to register ZIP top-level domains. There has been a lot of debate within different cybersecurity communities highlighting the dangers of misusing .zip domains, in this article there is an example of an active campaign tricking the users to open a compressed .zip file that contains an infected malware tool.

### Techniques: Exploring your attack surface.

The friends from Maltego published a detailed post about how to assess your attack surface in order to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Even if the post is oriented to a business or infrastructure perspective, you should consider to implement similar approaches to your personal/professional information that is available online regularly such as checking you email on breach databases, accessing externally to your social media profiles to identify what information can be seen from outside...

### Techniques: Investigating trolling campaigns.

OSINT investigators need to learn how to identify trolling, and whether it's an isolated event or part of an organised campaign. This article provides some insights and resources in order to help practitioners

### Tools: Bellingcat's OpenStreetMap search tool.

Overpass Turbo, the web-based data filtering tool for OpenStreetMap, is the foundation of several tools developed lately to ease the task of geolocating content. Bellingcat's has developed a free tool but that requires a Google account to use it, that achieves the task of helping investigators to geolocate pictures based on different elements on them taking as reference all the available "tags" that OpenStreetMap and Overpass-turbo provides. From natural elements such as rivers, lakes, mountains, cliffs to public transport stops, restaurants or fountains. You can select multiple identifiers from your image of reference and the tool will automatically build the required query and display to you possible candidates that contains matches of the previous elements.
