#### News: Meta Verified.

Meta is testing a subscription based verify option, like Twitter, for Instagram and Facebook. This "status" sign will require a government ID to be issued and will provide to its subscribers proactive account protection, access to account support, and increased visibility and reach.

#### Tools: HTMLs to PDF.

I had the need to convert several (hundreds) HTML files to PDFs in a simple and fast way in Linux CLI. I wanted an alternative to complex libraries so... ChatGPT (my new best friend) suggested me "wkhtmltopdf". An amazing open source project, simple and easy, that converts HTML files to PDF or images.

#### Tools: Public APIs collection.

APIs provide access to a wide amount of different data sources, from information about the weather to track airplanes or maritime vessels. This GitHub repo contains plenty of different public APIs to benefit from.

#### Tools: RustScan, 65535 ports in 30seconds?

I was very skeptical to believe that a port scanner was able to do the entire range in 30 seconds... and I was wrong. RustScan uses a syntax very similar to Nmap to scan, with a bit of system tweaks, the entire range in a very fast time. It is also available as a Docker image but I had better response times using it directly from Linux.
