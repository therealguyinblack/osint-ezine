### Addons: Uniform-Timezone.

This extension converts and decodes, where possible, complete upload/post date-time values into standard timezones (like UTC or your machine's local timezone) and allows the conversion to any other timezone, besides exporting/copying all values.

### Crypto: Proof-of-humanity.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI (ChatGPT) has decided to take over Elon and become the next Lex Luthor of the universe. Sam recently co-founded Worldcoin ([https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/](https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/)) some sort of biometric solution were physical orbs will scan the eyes of the users ion order to perform a _Proof-of-humanity_ based on blockchain. From all the articles, news and reviews, the only person that I have found that provided the best and detailed explanation about the topic is our dear guru, Vitalik Buterin, developer of Ethereum.

### Crypto: TxStreet.

TxStreet is a live transaction and mempool visualizer featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Monero and Litecoin. When a new transaction is broadcasted to a cryptocurrency network, a person appears and attempts to board a bus in real time. If the transaction has a high enough fee, they will board the first bus and be ready to be included in the next mined block. If there are too many transactions to be included in the next block, and the transaction didn't pay a high enough fee, the person will either wait in line or board a different bus. The movement speed of a person represents how high of a fee they paid compared to the current median fee. The size of a person represents the size of the transaction in bytes or gas.

### News: Wireshark is 25 years old!

Old memories, evenings of WEP cracking, traffic sniffing with Wireshark and then, discovering the secret life of your neighbours because Windows Messenger was not encrypted at that time... Wireshark is 25 years old and still, is the tool of reference for analysing traffic data.

### Techniques: Can AI chatbots be used for geolocation?

Bellingcat has tested the geolocation capabilities of Bing AI, which was accessed via the Skype client on the desktop app, and Bard, Google’s new AI chatbot which was recently launched in Brazil and the EU. Both chatbots use different language models; Bard uses PaLM-2 while Bing uses GPT – the same as that used in the popular ChatGPT bot. The results are quite impressive and with the incoming possibility to use images or access the Internet, is an approach that we should definitely consider in our future investigations.

### Bonus: My book recommendations.

Metal music, horror movies and... books! That are my three pillars. If you are going to enjoy a break or do you want some recommendations about books, here there are some interesting ones that I have read this year so far:



**Covid-19: The Great Reset. Klaus Schwab and Thierry Malleret.**

This piece was written amidst of the Covid pandemic and foreseen some scenarios, possibilities and outcomes with regards how the global pandemic would affect us. I wanted to give it a try after sometime to see how accurate or incorrect the authors were about it and... surprisingly, some concepts and idea totally shocked me.

The book talks about: #politics, #economics and #sociology.



**Tracers in the Dark. Andy Greenberg.**

I have started the year with this book regarding crypto and in my opinion, should be considered a compulsory lecture for anyone involved on crypto investigations. I had the feeling reading it that I was in between a real operation and a Netflix show. I highly recommend it as it describes the early days of crypto-tracing and the development of new tactics and tools such as Chainalysis.

The book talks about: #cryptocurrencies, #technology, #crime.



**Earthlings. Sayaka Murata.**

Disclaimer: It is a horror gory fiction novel. Earthlings is a novel about violence, sex, mental issues and also, love, depression and lost souls. Based on a contemporary Japan, it describes the history of a young girl that needs to find herself in a planet where she doesn't belong to.

The book talks about: #japan, #fiction, #horror.
