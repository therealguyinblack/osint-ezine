### Addons: Sample, audio recorder.

Sometimes the easy task of recording audio from a clip or a web video becomes a nightmare in some operating systems such as Linux. Sample is an extension only for Chrome :( , that allows you to sample and edit audio directly from the browser with the possibility to record up to 15 minutes continuously.

### AI: Stanford's Smallville is officially open-source.

25 AI agents inhabit a digital Westworld, unaware that they are living in a simulation. They go to work, gossip, organize socials, make new friends, and even fall in love. Each has unique personality and backstory. Smallville is among the most inspiring AI agent experiments in 2023. A population of AI can play out the evolution of an entire civilization. Endless new possibilities ahead. Gaming will be the first to feel the impact.

### AI: Weaponizing machine-learning models.

Quite technical post that explains how some red team tasks such as supply chain attacks can be performed by leveraging machine-learning models. A lot of people is focused on the use of AI for artistic or generative purposes but when talking about cybersecurity, AI is an amazing ally for reconnaissance tasks such as pattern creation or fuzzing.

### Learning: An empirical study and evaluation of modern CAPTCHAs.

CAPTCHAs, how many you have to solve each day? This academic paper contains a recent study about how they work and the results of an evaluation on users solving performance and perception of them.

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12108)\

### Learning: The Verification Handbook.

A great resource for investigating platforms and online accounts to reveal inauthentic activity and manipulated content. I recommend the entire book but if you don't have too much time, the case studies are very good. As usual, please, if you consider that the book is of your interest, purchasing it will help the authors.

### Privacy: ProtonMail data request compliance.

Another article and it is not the first time that this conversation shows up in one of my OSINT trainings about ProtonMail, the secure email provider, complying with legal authorities. One needs to understand how their technology work and what parts of their service are NOT encrypted, usually involves metadata and clear information sent from unencrypted providers such as Gmail.

### Privacy: Tor introduces Proof-of-Work Defense.

The Tor project is enhancing the security for its onion services adding a component commonly found in some blockchains, the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. It would be a a deterrent against denial of service attacks (DoS) as the initial idea of PoW before it was used on blockchains such as Bitcoin, was to combat spam attacks.

### Privacy: X new Privacy Policy.

X (former Twitter) has updated their Privacy Policy that would go into effect on 29 September 2023. After reading it (yes, I enjoy reading all that long boring documents...) I have came to the same conclussions as the people from Mashable.com so here there are the biggest changes and insights from it. Two remarks from my side, biometric data collection and AI data for training.

### Techniques: Digging into Russian disinformation infrastructure.

I love to investigate infrastructure, the different components and technologies involved in crimes and illegal activities are a crucial part and in most of the cases, the final step to truly identify the actors involved. In this article from @Nixintel, a detailed infrastructure investigation about Russian disinformation is shown using different methods such as command-line tools or web services like the Wayback machine.

### Techniques: Discord OSINT.

Discord has shifted into a centerpiece for OSINT investigations of all kind, from terrorists to extremists, Discord always pop up. The following GitHub project contains an updated list of resources, services and tools to perform different investigative actions on the platform.

### Techniques: Know Your Meme.

What started as a joke (Nazi Furries anyone?) it has become a very powerful database of internet culture. Know Your Meme is an archive of images and videos used as memes and explained in detail by the community with facts such as origin, year or category.

### Techniques: LittleSis (opposite of Big Brother).

LittleSis is a free database of who-knows-who at the heights of business and governments. Ideal for the ones who are researching political matters, I have tried with several local politicians of different countries with surprising results, very useful when checking names found on political forums and you are not aware of the political affiliation or the country.

### Techniques: Saunas and Swastikas.

The friends from Bellingcat presented a very interesting and insightful geolocation investigation involving far-right supporters "enjoying saunas" in Finland during a Neo-nazi summertime meet up.

### Techniques: Unmasking Cloudflare hosted sites.

Cloudflare, a popular content delivery network and DDoS protection service, is widely used to enhance the security and performance of websites. One of its key features is hiding the actual IP address of the origin server, making it challenging for attackers to directly target the server. However, in some instances, it may be necessary to identify the real IP address of a Cloudflare-hosted site for legitimate reasons, such as security assessments or debugging.

### Techniques: Using sock puppets to gather SOCMINT.

Maltego published a blog post with several tips and techniques on how to obtain social media intelligence (SOCMINT) by using investigative accounts or "sock puppets".

### Tools: Filmot

Flimot is a public search engine which indexes YouTube metadata and enables searching of YouTube videos and channels using contents, subtitle content and other extended parameters.

### Tools: LinkWarden.

Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages. The objective is to organize useful webpages and articles you find across the web in one place, and since useful webpages can go away, Linkwarden also saves a copy of each webpage as a Screenshot and PDF, ensuring accessibility even if the original content is no longer available.

### Tools: Psudohash password generator.

Password guessing is a technique under valuated in OSINT but very fruitful for passive activities such as breach databases querying. When generating passwords, permutations are the trickiest part but thanks to tools like Psudohash, it is possible to generate millions of keyword-based passwords in seconds.

### Web3: Querio.

A search engine focused on Web3 resources such as blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, NFT's and other trendy actors. Very fast, updated and with a simple and efficient UI.
