### Privacy: Apple's personal safety user guide (yes, Apple).

This month in the privacy world, Apple surprises us with a guide on PDF format with several tips and settings to protect the safety and privacy of its users. It is very interesting and it seems that is totally aligned with different guides available in other sources, it contains different sections, covering topics like how to protect sharing content on Airdrop or how to check for AirTags using an "Android" device.

### Tools: Maigret on Maltego.

Maigret is a well-known OSINT tool to check whether an email address is used on different social media platforms. The tool is not one hundred percent accurate and gives some false positives but is worthy to add it to our toolkit arsenal. This month was published on Maltego's blog a guide on how to install and use the Maltego Transform that makes use of Maigret. Personally I was using all this kind of tools with Maltego using custom transforms so the tutorial and the code can be used to allow you to create your own transforms for your tools.
