### News: Security vulnerability in Tails 5.0 browser.

This vulnerability allows a malicious website to bypass some of the security built in Tor Browser and access information from other websites. For example, after you visit a malicious website, an attacker controlling this website might access the password or other sensitive information that you send to other websites afterwards during the same Tails session.

### Privacy: Vodafone plans carrier-level user tracking for targeted ads.

Vodafone is piloting a new advertising ID system called _TrustPid_, which will work as a persistent user tracker at the mobile Internet Service Provider (ISP) level. From a privacy point of view, is a total disaster as it will make more difficult to avoid the tracking but, from the law enforcement perspective... it can help in some investigations where this data would be possible to request legally.

### Tools: Spoofbox, fake data.

I am totally against the used of automated tools to create sock puppets, I believe that the investigators need to put a bit of effort giving personality to any cover or fake account they create. This online service creates fake data with the possibility to choose the country and that's why I am sharing it with you, it is very helpful to find postal codes of locations if you need a fast address to use somewhere:
