### News: Twitter admits it mistakenly removed Ukraine open source intelligence accounts.

Twitter said it had mistakenly suspended the accounts of open source intelligence reporters posting about Russia’s military build-up around Ukraine, leading to many of them accusing the Russian state of launching a “bot” campaign against them.

### Tools: Telepathy.

Telegram is still one of the main places to go in OSINT investigations. Telepathy is a Python tool that helps the investigators to save chats, content and other data from the accounts, one of the features is the possibility of download all the media content from a chat/group.

### Tools: Travel Time Map.

An online service that allows you to measure how far you can reach in a given time frame and with different transport options like driving, cycling or walking. Very interesting to find possible escape routes of an individual in a given time.

### Tools: Twayback.

What an amazing tool! Twayback downloads deleted Tweets that are archived on the Wayback Machine in a very easy way. The tool depends on the Wayback machine so sometime you will find pictures and other times only text but is a very interesting and useful approach for any OSINT investigation on Twitter.
