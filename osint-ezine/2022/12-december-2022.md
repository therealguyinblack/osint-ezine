### News: Beta of Android 13 on Windows 11.

Android 13 will be launched soon on Windows 11 natively (via WSA) and that would mean a possible end for the use of emulators. Sock puppets accounts would benefit from this because we will be able to use applications directly from Windows without the use of virtual machines and emulators.

### News: LastPass hacked... again.

The online password management service LastPass has been hacked twice this year. The data stolen this time as BSI (basic subscriber information) such as billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, IP addresses and other related metadata. If you are using LastPass and you have set up a complex master password, you should be on the "safe" side (online and password manager is a concept that I do not endorse). Otherwise, consider using a more secure but cumbersome solution like local vaults and manual sync (like local Keepass files).

### News: Skynet is here... ChatGPT3.5.

Terminator 2 was right and the end of the world due a malicious AI starting the third world war is closer. The third (.5) version of the algorithm that interacts with users in a conversational way, ChatGPT, was all over the news, especially on Twitter. We have read almost every possibility, machines with soul, the algorithm is replacing humans already... from all this noise I always recommend to go directly to the sources to have a clear understanding of what's going on and try it for yourself, in my case, I am considering on create next year newsletters using it while drinking mojito's at the beach... xD.
