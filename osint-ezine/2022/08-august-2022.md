### Addons: Selection Search.

The tool 'Selection Search' is a small tool for Chrome and Firefox that enables you to quickly search for selected text. The default selection has Google, YouTube and Stack overflow, but it's extremely easy to add your own websites. It has a lot of customizable options too, to open links in a new window, incognito mode, a tab and it's even possible to assign hotkeys.

### Crypto: Tornado Cash banned and blacklisted by US.

The (in)famous crypto mixer "Tornado Cash" has disappeared this month from existence. The US Federal Treasure has blacklisted and banned it, that means that any US citizen will be criminally charged if they use this service. For the rest of us, "Tornado" has disappeared as it's online presence has been erased from almost everywhere where US can reach, that includes domain, server, GitHub repository...

### News: Cyber Weapons used in the Ukraine-Russia war.

A very interesting report full of detail about the different range of cyber weapons used in the conflict. The document explains in-depth the different malware and units involved in the different cyber-attacks allegedly committed by Russian cyber special forces.

### Privacy: DuckDuckGo Email.

It seems that nowadays, the world of disposable/temporal/redirecting email address is on trend. DuckDuckGo has open the service to everyone (it was a closed beta test till this month) providing to the users unlimited disposable private addresses that can be used on sites with high spam risks or one-time registrations:

### Techniques: Drones & OSINT: What flies ahead.

Transport intelligence is full of resources to perform OSINT on maritime vessels, aircraft's or trains but there are not too much resources for Drones. On this article there are some tools and techniques to gather more information about them.

### Techniques: I do not want to visit this website.

Great article as usual by _@technisette_ where multiple options to visit a website (or its cached/stored/archived/saved versions) are presented without the need of open it directly. As a remark, at the end of the article some command line tools are presented too to make things more automate.

### Techniques: Survey, The OSINT tools needed.

525 professionals from different backgrounds had answer a survey by Bellingcat about what type of tools are needed for investigations. From the results, it is very relevant to see that the top entries are search engines, a free resource that has been there always and I see nowadays a lot of investigators that are not using them efficiently.

### Techniques: The weaponizing of smartphones on the battlefield.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is showing a lot of different techniques and resources regarding the gathering of intelligence on the battlefield. This article gives some notes on how smartphone location data can be used to obtain accurate information.

### Tools: cURL for OSINT.

cURL is a command line program used for transferring data with URLs since 1998! As many other command line interface (cli) tools like dig, whois or wget, curl allows the users to perform lots of different tasks through the cli, in this repo can be found multiple examples of usage for OSINT purposes.

### Tools: Geogramint.

An OSINT Geolocalization tool for Telegram that find nearby users and groups. Written in Python, it allows the user to search for a location and then, if the Telegram users have enable the option "Find People Nearby", they will appear on the map and exported in a JSON file.

### Web3: Exploring the unprecedented privacy risks of the Metaverse.

An impressive academic research paper titled "Exploring the Unprecedented Privacy Risks of the Metaverse", explains how different user data can be retrieved from a friendly-looking "escape room" that is able to determine gender, ethnicity, location... based on different parameters measured by the the use of VR equipment.
