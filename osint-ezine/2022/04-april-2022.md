### News: ProtonMail free accounts deactivation.

ProtonMail has started to deactivate accounts inactive for more than one year (free tier) so if you are using one for your sock puppets I highly suggest give them some movement before getting deleted, once deleted, it will be never possible to recover or re-register it

### News: Twitter has a new owner...

A difficult topic to address from my point of view... should an individual have complete control over policies affecting almost 400 million users?
