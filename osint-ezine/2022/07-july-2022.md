### Learning: Advanced Google searches.

Henkvan Ess, a well known OSINT investigator, has held a presentation for the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) about the discrepancies of results that Google nowadays returns. In the video, Henk shows different ways to make the searches in order to get the desired results.

### Learning: Investigating extremist groups.

A very interesting conversation about how to investigate extremists groups by four renown OSINT experts. They cover some basics like the use of VPNs and VMs but then they shift to how to find content, countermeasures...

### Learning: MetaOSINT resources.

MetaOSINT has been updated with several new services. If you are not aware of it, MetaOSINT is a project that aggregates multiple OSINT resources about different topics like: Web Search Engines, Media Search, Academic Resources, Social Media and much more in two flavours. One way of accessing the data is from an interactive map where you can click for the resources and the second way, a searchable table:

### Learning: TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals.

TryHackMe, the online cyber security gamified learning platform,has updated the content of their training **Linux Fundamentals** which it is "free". A perfect starter for any investigator eager to learn about how to use the most powerful operating system for almost anything ;)

### Tools: HashAtIt. Search for hashtags in multiple sources.

HashAtIt is an online service that allows the users to search for hashtags in several platforms, it makes searches for hashtag son Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and YouTube at the time of writing these lines.

### Tools: Memory.lol, historical information from 442 million Twitter accounts.

This project can currently be used to look up 542 million historical screen names for 443 million Twitter accounts. Most of this data has been scraped from either the Twitter Stream Grab or the Wayback Machine. Coverage should be fairly good (for non-protected accounts) going back to 2011, which is when the Twitter Stream Grab was launched.

### Tools: PyTok, a tool to collect video, text and metadata from TikTok.

An amazing Python tool that is able to retrieve different data from TikTok without an account (some limits on the amount of data available) pulling directly the information from the JSON endpoints:

### Tools: Inteltechniques tools.

Michael Bazzell has launched again its tools section on its website where you can find plenty of online services to perform OSINT like look for usernames, search for emails and much more:

### Web3: Zapper, a Web3 resource aggregator.

Nowadays, Web3 is a very decentralized and at the same time, disorganized environment. Zapper solves the issue scaling all the information in an accessible way, from NFTs to DAOs:
