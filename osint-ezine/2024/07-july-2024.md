This issue includes topics such as an infographic featuring recommended software for privacy; Apple releasing their maps service for web; various articles about data breaches; learning resources for Bitcoin investigations and Python programming; a plugin to integrate AI with Obsidian; an amazing tool for making screenshots; the state-of-the-art on crypto for this half year, and much more!

### Crypto: Binance Half-Year Report 2024.

Binance is one of the biggest players in the crypto environment. Their new "Half-Year Report" covers their overview of the ecosystem and what aspects of relevance they have spotted. The different sections - Layers 1 and 2, Stablecoins, NFTs, or Gaming - present valuable information to stay updated on the blockchain world.

### Crypto: Bitcoin Tracking.

A valuable guide to crypto investigations, this article highlights the relevance of Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency most used in criminal activities and provides numerous basic resources to start investigations where this crypto-asset is being used.

### Crypto: Haveno, Tor and Monero.

Law enforcement agencies and other regulators are making efforts to reduce or minimize the abuse of Monero for illegal uses. **Haveno** advertises itself as "a non-custodial, decentralized exchange platform for crypto and fiat currencies built on Tor and using Monero". I truly believe in the power of privacy technologies to protect our rights regarding our activities online, but all these technologies and platforms can be a double-edged sword. It is therefore better to know that they exist and where to find them, rather than being unaware and suffering the consequences.

### Learning: Basics of Python.

Bellingcat has published a new video tutorial as part of its "Tech Series" where they explain how to install Python on Windows and MacOS. Python is widely adopted by experts to develop all kinds of tools, and it is one of the best skills you can learn to improve your OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) capabilities. As a bonus, I prefer not to share YouTube videos due to their tracking cookies and other telemetry artifacts they contain. When I need to watch YouTube videos, I use the free alternative called [Invidious](https://docs.invidious.io/instances/). There are multiple instances available using this software, allowing you to watch content in a more private and free way without worrying about Google spying on you.

### News: Apple Maps Web Version.

Apple has launched Apple Maps in public beta, allowing users worldwide to access maps directly from their browser. Still in an early phase, this feature will enhance our GEOINT toolkit as users can get driving and walking directions, find places with photos, hours, ratings, and reviews.

### News: AT\&T Massive Hacking.

A massive hacking incident in April resulted in the illegal downloading of approximately 109 million customer accounts at the U.S. wireless company AT\&T. The stolen information can easily provide cybercriminals, spies, and stalkers with a logbook of the communications and activities of AT\&T customers over several months, including where those customers live and traveled. This news came at a perfect time as I am sharing a series of articles on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-much-do-you-think-technology-companies-know-ismael-alvarez-n7lte) in which I am discussing the topics of personal data and what information different service providers know about us.

### News: Google's Dark Web Monitoring Service.

Dark web report will become available to all users with a Google Account. Dark web report is integrated with **Results about you** as a combined solution to help users protect their online presence. **Results about you** is a feature that helps you find out if your personal contact info, like your home address, phone number, or email address shows up in search results.

### News: The Multi-Billion Dollar Marketplace for Scammers.

Huion Guarantee is an online marketplace that has become widely used by scam operators in South East Asia, including those involved in so-called "pig butchering" scams. Merchants on the platform offer technology, data, and money laundering services, and have engaged in transactions totaling at least $11 billion. This article by the crypto company Elliptic delves into the topic of online scammers and how they abuse marketplaces like Huion Guarantee.

### Privacy: Data Broker Breaches.

Data or information brokers collect, process, and sell data to third parties. This data includes consumer behaviors, preferences, and sensitive information such as financial records. Their role has become more prominent as businesses rely on data-driven decision-making. Data brokers gather data from various sources, including online activities and public records, but... what happens when bad actors obtain illegal access to their databases? This article covers the topic of predicting over 17,400 data breaches by 2025.

### Privacy: Paris 2024 Olympics Android App Analysis.

Malcore, a company that provides cybersecurity analysis services, published a report where they analyzed the Android version of the official Paris 2024 Olympics app. On their findings, they emphasize the amount of trackers and third-parties collecting data from users and what measures can be taken to reduce the collection.

### Privacy: Privacy Resources Infographic.

Attached to this newsletter, you can find a compilation that I have created recommending software focused on privacy. I am not affiliated with any company and most of the services are open-source. The different products are listed in order of my personal preference, but all of them are focused on protecting personal information by using various technologies: limiting ad-tracking for search engines; disabling telemetry in web browsers; no-logs policies for VPNs; and end-to-end encryption for voice, video, and text messaging.<br>

### Privacy: Proton Privacy Guides.

This month I discovered the launch of Proton Docs (see Tools section) and while browsing the Proton.me website, I came across a nice collection of updated privacy guides that cover all kinds of areas in a very clear format with valuable tips. From password management to cryptocurrencies or how to protect personal information online, it is very helpful for enhancing your skills on this topic.

### Tools: Obsidian and AI, Smart Connections.

A lot of people use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the mind mapping and note-taking app, to improve their OSINT capabilities. In my case, my main knowledge database also utilizes the Markdown language (https://www.markdownguide.org/), so I use Obsidian for OSINT workflows to guide me through my investigations. This plugin called Smart Connections allows you to integrate a local LLM frontend such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) and enrich your Obsidian notes with the power of AI. Thanks to this plugin, you can make queries, use your notes as base content, or generate powerful insights.

### Tools: OpenRefine.

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most significant revolutions of recent years. It allows us to perform amazing things, such as generating text, analyzing information, and extracting relevant data. However, all these wonders come with a price: tons of data. OpenRefine is a powerful free, open-source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data. It works with a wide variety of sources, including compressed files or even pasted data from the clipboard.

### Tools: Proton Docs.

Proton has launched a new feature in its Proton Drive product, Docs. In a similar way to [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) or [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/), it allows users to create documents in a private and encrypted manner, with the possibility of sharing and collaborating in real-time with other users. It also provides functionalities such as leaving comments and replies, viewing cursors, and presence indicators. I have the feeling that this will be very useful on CTFs (Capture The Flag) and other similar challenges.

### Tools: Shot-scraper.

For a long time, I stopped making my life difficult by automating the capture of website screenshots. I used to develop complex Python scripts with headless browsers and intricate functions until **shot-scraper** entered my workflow. A command-line utility for taking automated screenshots of websites, its simplicity belies powerful capabilities, making it my go-to tool when it comes to capturing graphical content from websites. It also allows me to define specific HTML elements and execute JavaScript.
