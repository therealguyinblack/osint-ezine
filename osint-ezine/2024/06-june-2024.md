### AI: LLM Agents Exploiting Zero-Days.

Impressive research paper were a group of experts have shown that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. Taking ChatGPT-4 as the model used, they estimate a cost of $24.39 per successful exploit.

### AI: OpenAI and Apple partnership.

Apple is integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access ChatGPT’s capabilities including image and document understanding without needing to jump between tools. It is not yet clear if this would be a new feature or part of "Apple Intelligence" but EU users may have limited or no access to it.

### News: Meta Pauses AI Models Launch in Europe.

Meta will not launch its Meta AI models in Europe for now after the Irish privacy regulator told it to delay its plan to harness data from Facebook and Instagram users. The move by Meta came after complaints and a call by advocacy group NOYB to data protection authorities in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain to act against the company. At issue is Meta's plan to use personal data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models without seeking consent, although the company has said it would use publicly available and licensed online information.

### Techniques: Everything About SOCMINT and Investigations.

Social media intelligence (SOCMINT) is considered a sub-discipline of open-source intelligence (OSINT). SOCMINT can be defined as the techniques, technologies, and tools that allow for the collection and analysis of information from social media platforms. In this article, Maltego will walk you through everything you need to know about social media intelligence and the best practices for conducting social media investigations.

### Techniques: Gaming Threats.

An article about IDN (Internationalized Domain Names ) homoglyph attacks. The post describes how "similar" domain names to big gaming actors such as Discord, Steam or Roblox are used for targeted attacks. This technique (IDN Homoglyph Attack) need to be taken into consideration when performing OSINT searches related to CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence).

### Techniques: Pivot Atlas.

Pivot Atlas is an educational pivoting handbook for Cyber Threat Intelligence and OSINT analysts. The website contains simple reference material for how to make the best use of various selectors such as IP addresses and file hashes. The goal is to map the pivotability of every type of artifact that analysts might encounter in the course of their investigations.
