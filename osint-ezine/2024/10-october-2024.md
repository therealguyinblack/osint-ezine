### AI: Apple Introduced it's AI Engine... not for EU Users.

Apple users outside the EU are starting to benefit from this month from the AI functionalities on their devices. Apple Intelligence provide features from writing tools to help refine your writing, to summarized notifications that surface what’s most important, to the ability to search for almost anything in your photos and videos by simply describing it. Bad times for EU users I guess...
