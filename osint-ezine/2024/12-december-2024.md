### AI: Free AI Training Dataset Funded by OpenAI and Microsoft.

The Harvard Law School Library's Library Innovation Lab has launched the Institutional Data Initiative (IDI) to make public domain materials from knowledge institutions, like over a million books scanned at Harvard Library, available for AI training. IDI aims to address the lack of diversity and potential biases in current AI training data by expanding access to these public domain resources.

### Crypto: Cryptocurrency in the War Zone, Syria.

The Assad regime in Syria has collapsed, following a recent offensive by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other opposition factions. HTS, an international designated terrorist group, was once associated with Al-Qaeda but officially split in 2016. The regime's collapse has significant geopolitical implications for the region and great power competition, as Syria was a critical link between Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah, and an important aspect of Russia's power projection in the Middle East. The article delves deeper into the crypto nexus of these developments and highlight relevant crypto stories.

### Crypto: The Hawk Tuah Memecoin, Fraud?

Hailey Welch, known for her internet-famous catch-phrase “Hawk Tuah,” launched a memecoin on December 4, 2024. Critics of the launch claim those associated with the project defrauded innocent investors; though project insiders deny such claims. What is uncontested is that shortly after public launch the price of the memecoin skyrocketed, a small portion of owners sold off their tokens, and the token’s value neared 0 as of December 13, 2024.

### Learning: OSINT vs OSINF.

Before Open-Source Intelligence becomes intelligence, it’s something else: Open-Source Information. Think of OSINF as the raw materials of OSINT; that vast collection of data freely available to anyone, from news articles and social media posts to government reports and academic papers. OSINT, meanwhile, is the finished product; the result of analysing and interpreting this raw data. The transition from OSINT to OSINF is known as the ‘Intelligence Cycle’.

Each piece of data has been analysed for authenticity by CIR Investigators.

### News: Interpol Urges to end Pig Butchering term.

INTERPOL urges an end to the term "pig butchering" due to its harmful impact on online scam victims.

### Privacy: Governments Turn to Element and Matrix.

As an expert on decentralised technologies, it is difficult for me to understand why governments, law enforcement bodies or even military units are still relying for part of their communications on solutions such as WhatsApp, Signal or Zoom. There are different technologies, open-source, readily available and with proven levels of security to use as alternatives. The Matrix protocol is the most relevant example and in this post, we can see how different governments and international bodies such as NATO are encouraging its adoption.

### Privacy: The Breachies 2024.

Every year, countless emails hit our inboxes telling us that our personal information was accessed, shared, or stolen in a data breach. In many cases, there is little we can do. Most of us can assume that at least our phone numbers, emails, addresses, credit card numbers, and social security numbers are all available somewhere on the internet. This article by the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) shares the worst, weirdest, most impactful data breaches of the year.

### Bonus: OSINT eZine 2024 Recap.

12 issues and 222 articles, as we reflect on the year gone by, a comprehensive look at the newsletter content in 2024 reveals noteworthy trends:

**Learning**, **Tools**, and **Techniques** emerge as clear favourites, each comprising 17.2% of the shared articles. These categories highlight the enthusiasm for diving into OSINT methodologies, practical cybersecurity tools, and hands-on investigative strategies. **AI** is another standout, making up 15.6% of the content, with a focus on generative models, their ethical implications, and their growing role in cybersecurity and digital transformation.

**Privacy** and **Crypto** topics also play a significant role, contributing 14.1% and 13.5% respectively. **Privacy** content emphasizes data protection, OPSEC best practices, and surveillance concerns, while crypto articles explore blockchain technology, fraud prevention, and the intersection of AI and decentralised finance. Though categories like **Web3** and **infographics** are less represented, I have always tried to provide the best content that matches the aim of this _eZine_.

**AI** clearly has been the key theme and 2024 has been a year were we have seen a lot of advances in the field, nevertheless, the _eZine_ has focused as well on providing educational resources.

In addition to this figures, the _eZine_ has migrated to a new email domain and also, all the previous content is available on GitHub and [GitBook](https://therealguyinblack.gitbook.io/osint-ezine) because maybe you are not aware but each issue has its own unique cover.

2025 will bring more content and I only want to thank all of you, the readers, for your time and finding interesting this monthly newsletter.
