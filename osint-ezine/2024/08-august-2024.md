### Addons: Chrome AI Features.

Google has implemented new AI features on its products. The most relevant for us, online investigators (or curious xD) is the new Google Lens in the Chrome browser. The new Lens allows users to select areas of images and ask questions about it, obtaining results from the web, without having to close or switch tabs.

### AI: Brave Custom Local AI Models.

With the release of Brave version 1.69, desktop users can now integrate their own AI models into the Brave browser via its built-in assistant, Brave Leo. This new feature, known as "Bring Your Own Model" (BYOM), facilitates the connection of Leo with AI models running locally on users devices or on remote servers, including third-party services like ChatGPT. This integration aims to enhance user privacy and security by allowing local models to ensure that data remains on the user's device, while remote models make direct requests from the user's device to the model endpoint, bypassing Brave entirely.

### News: NIST's First Post-Quantum Standards.

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), published this August the first three encryption standards designed to resist an attack from quantum computers. From all the different resources discussing about the topic, I have two to share with you. The first one, the official NIST publication, it is essential to know from the sources when these kind of topics are released. The second source is coming from Cloudflare. In a blog post, they have covered the topic in detail and in a very clear format, suitable for all audiences.

### News: Telegram CEO Arrest.

A bit of self-promotion here but on this post, I share my views on why France was not attacking freedom of speech in the arrest of Telegram's CEO, Pavel Durov, but tackling crime. Telegram made a media campaign talking about compliance and legal adoptance but is well known across all Europe, that Telegram refuses consistently to provide any information about individuals committing crimes, something that the most private-friendly companies such as Proton, Tuta or Signal are providing within their capabilities. This article reflects on the subject and how difficult it is to combat crimes on platforms like Telegram.

### Privacy: Is Tinder's New AI Photo Feature Safe?

Earlier this summer, Tinder announced Photo Selector, an AI tool to help pick out the best pictures for your dating app profile. But privacy experts warn that there may be risks associated with the tool. Photo Selector works by taking a photo of yourself for facial recognition and allowing Tinder to see your photo roll. If you consent to this feature, Tinder gets access to your biometric data (unique physical characteristics in the selfie), and access to your on-device photos. What happens next?

### Tools: IP Ranges.

When investigating infrastructure, networks and logs, the IP address selector is the queen of the kingdom. Sometimes we discover a juicy IP hidden in a log, like a precious treasure until we sadly discover that it belongs to an online bot, a scanner software or a web crawler. This GitHub repository keeps lists of known actors such as Facebook, Telegram, Amazon, Cloudflare or Bing.

### Tools: OSINT-timeline.

Maybe you don't know it but our OSINT master Yoda, _@Dutchosintguy_, also develops tools and scripts. He has created a Python-based application designed to help you create, manage, and visualize timelines for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigations. The tool allows users to document events, link related entities, and visualize interactions over time through an intuitive web interface. You can also export the timelines and query results in various formats, including CSV, Excel, and PDF.
