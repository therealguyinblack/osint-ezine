### Addons: Forensic OSINT.

Forensic OSINT is a tool created by OSINT expert Ritu Gill, which also exists as a Chrome extension. It enables users to capture websites and their associated artifacts, similar to the popular tool Hunchly.

### Addons: Web Archives.

Armin Sebastian (@dessant), the developer of my beloved addon Search-by-image, is also the creator of Web Archives. Now that Google has delisted the "cache:" operator (see article in News section), Web Archives is a browser extension for viewing archived and cached versions of web pages, available for Chrome, Edge and Safari.

### AI: Anything in Any Scene.

While all the people was impressed with OpenAI's Sora, their AI mode that can create realistic videos, I was amazed by the capabilities of this publication were the researches are able to add fake elements in any scene. I was foreseeing this kind of technologies being (ab)used for media campaigns but with this research, is clear to me that potential threats, as realistic video simulations, are closer.

### AI: Microsoft and OpenAI Report on Users Activity.

Microsoft, in collaboration with OpenAI, is publishing a research on emerging threats in the age of AI, focusing on identified activity associated with known threat actors Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, and others. It is interesting to know how they have obtained the information... are user's chats on ChatGPT not so private? ;)

### AI: Models and Methods and the use of AI.

Enisa, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity published a report to introduce cyber risk and cyber insurance, provide an overview of existing research and modelling approaches, and identify gaps for upcoming research projects related to AI.

### Crypto: Binance Delisting Monero.

The centralized cryptocurrency exchange has announced the delisting of several cryptocurrencies including the king of the privacy coins, Monero. It is very relevant for several reasons with regards investigations, Monero has less room of movement when delisted from these services but also, Monero users will use alternatives services such as P2P DEXs (peer-to-peer decentralized exchanges) that make more difficult the investigations.

### Crypto: Bitcoin Inscriptions Landscape.

Lately I have been diving into the world of Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions. For the ones not aware, basically the NFTs in Bitcoin (basically). This post by Binance Research explores protocols, inscriptions outside of Bitcoin and related topics about this "new" phenomena.

### Learning: Beginner’s Guide to Tracking Malware Infrastructure.

Censys has published a beginner's guide on how to investigate malware infrastructure. The technical infrastructure that involves criminal activities is a crucial part of any investigation, OSINT and Cybersecurity are two symbiotic fields and almost all the techniques and methodologies used in the one field, can be used in the other.

### News: Google "Cache" Discontinued.

It seems that the Google Cache feature was not longer needed as the Internet works very fast and smooth. It was a feature intended to be a "backup system" for certain websites that were down or slow, but Google, has decided to deprecate the feature. In the original tweet (now they are xweets?), they talk about the possibility of collaboration with the Internet Archive.

### News: iMessage Goes Quantum.

Following other platforms like Signal, Apple has announced it's cryptographic security upgrade in iMessage with the introduction of PQ3, a post-quantum protocol that advances the state of the art of end-to-end secure messaging.

### News: NIST Releases v2 of its Cybersecurity Framework.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has updated the widely used Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), its landmark guidance document for reducing cybersecurity risk. The new 2.0 edition is designed for all audiences, industry sectors and organization types, from the smallest schools and nonprofits to the largest agencies and corporations regardless of their degree of cybersecurity sophistication.

### Privacy: Browser Tests.

One of my favorite websites to check your browser privacy, on my trainings I put a lot of emphasis in protecting the online footprint of the investigators, these kind of services help us to know, through several tests, which browsers isolate websites to prevent them from sharing data to track you.

### Privacy: Security Questions.

Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum's Satoshi) published an OPSEC article about security questions giving as example, the case were a finance worker paid out $25 million after a video call with a deepfake from a "chief financial officer".

### Privacy: Signal Usernames.

Usernames instead of phone numbers in Signal... not yet. Signal is rolling out in beta a new functionality, highly requested, that is provide the ability to identify accounts with usernames instead of phone numbers, adding a layer of privacy to the service already in place in other platforms such as Viber or Telegram.

### Techniques: Digital Defense.

Digital Defense is an online platform but also, an open source project that compiled checklists of 300+ tips for protecting digital security and privacy. It covers different areas from Email to Social Media, Mobile Devices or even Smart Homes. One of the best projects related to privacy that I have discovered lately.

### Techniques: Google Operator "filetype:" Removed.

It is not clear yet what is going on with Google this month but, they seemed to have removed/discontinued two vital operators for online investigations, "cache:", explained in the news section and "filetype:". Several workarounds are appearing and seems that the combination of other operators such as "inurl:" or "intext:" can help as backup.

### Tools: Magika.

Magika is an AI powered file type detection tool by Google that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection. Under the hood, Magika employs a custom, highly optimized Keras model that only weighs about 1MB, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU. In an evaluation with over 1M files and over 100 content types (covering both binary and textual file formats), Magika achieves 99%+ precision and recall.

### Tools: Twikit.

A simple Python API wrapper to interact with twitter's unofficial API. You can log in to X using your account username, email address and password and use most features on X, such as posting and retrieving tweets, liking and following users.
