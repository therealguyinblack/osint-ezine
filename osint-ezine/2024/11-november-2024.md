### Crypto: Exploring the Future of AI Agents in Crypto.

On this year's Europol's SIRIUS annual conference, I dedicated a talk about AI agents. I think that autonomous agents that can solve specific tasks without user input is going to be one of the pillars of ~~future~~ present developments. Binance, on this report, explores how AI agents can enrich and expand the possibilities of crypto projects.

### Learning: Block Explorer Beginners Guide.

The vast majority of blockchains are public, that means that users can see the data of what transactions and activities have been performed on them. To interact with a blockchain, usually there are two options, the hard way or running our own node or using a web interface that eases the task for us. Blockchain explorer are web services, usually run by third-parties, that allows users to explore the data on the blockchain. This guide covers all the basics about explorers and how diving into this data can help us in our investigations.

### Learning: Foundations of Operationalizing MITRE ATT\&CK.

For some time, I am trying to adapt the MITRE ATT\&CK framework to OSINT. I already successfully adapted it for OPSEC (operational security) but I think that the cyber-threat framework, has a lot of power and opportunities beyond cybersecurity teams. This free training provides the fundamentals about the framework and how to use it.

### Techniques: Are AI Search Engines Reliable?

This article exposes a showcase of examples about how we should not rely 100% on AI search engines. This year, in Europol's annual SIRIUS conference, I delivered a talk and two workshops about artificial intelligence and in both, I remarked how relevant is to make proper tests and ensure that the tools or models we are using, are effective and reliable. The article uses ChatGPT Search as an example of how results are created from thin-air when the model is not able to provide reliability among other use cases.
