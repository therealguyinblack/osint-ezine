### AI: AI and Policing.

Europol's Innovation Lab new report on AI and Policing. It offers in-depth exploration of the applications and implications of AI in the field of law enforcement, underpinned by the European Union's regulatory framework. It also looks at concerns about data bias, fairness, and potential threats on privacy, accountability, human rights protection and discrimination, which are particularly relevant in the background of the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act.

### AI: Audiovisual Generative AI and Conflict Resolution.

[WITNESS](https://www.gen-ai.witness.org/about/) an international human rights organization that helps people to use video and technology to protect and defend their rights, has published it latest report that investigates the evolving relationship between synthetic media and the information landscape in situations of armed conflict and widespread violence, with a particular focus on implications for conflict resolution and peace processes.

### Learning: How Private Intelligence Companies Became the new Spymasters.

This article describes the evolution of private intelligence companies and their role in the digital age. It explores how these companies have become major players in the world of espionage, given the abundance of digital data. The article uses a real-world example of a Chinese intrusion into the Indian power grid, discovered by a private company, to illustrate this point.

### Learning: OSINT Tools Directory.

One ~~ring~~ website to rule them all. This online platform compiles different investigative resources by type such as images, email, phone number or IP address. It contains more than 80 items at the time of writing and it is very helpful to discover new tools and services that you may not be aware of, to integrate in your toolkit.

### Learning: Understanding Quantum Technologies.

**Olivier Ezratty** is a renown expert in the field of quantum technologies. He is the author of one of the best books I have read so far to understand quantum technologies and the best part, his book is entirely free and available to download. Every year he keeps updating the content and this month, he has released the 7th edition. The book is split between 5 different volumes so you can read the entire piece (I highly recommend it if you are interested on the topic), or you can dive into the different modules independently: Prologue; Computing Hardware; Computing Software; Communications and Sensing and Ecosystem.

### News: Access Wayback Machine from Google cache.

Google Search, after deprecating their archival "cache" operator, is now making it easier to access the past. Starting September, users everywhere can view archived versions of webpages directly through Google Search, with a simple link to the Internet Archiveâ€™s Wayback Machine. When you perform a search, if you click on the three dots after the result, the menu "More About This Page" will show you the link to the Wayback Machine if available.

### News: Facebook admits to scraping user's media content to train AI.

Facebook is scraping the public data of all Australian adults on the platform, it has acknowledged in an inquiry. The company does not offer Australians an opt out option like it does in the EU, because it has not been required to do so under privacy law. A similar concern has arise on LinkedIn, were they activate this option by default without notifying the users (double-check it and opt-out if needed).

### News: Telegram to improve moderation.

It seems as a "coincidence" but, after Telegram's CEO arrest in France, things have change considerably with Telegram and their reporting and moderation procedures. Currently Telegram is providing law enforcement information in a similar way to all the rest of online service providers. I hope that in a future, more "coincidences" as this one can be avoided and no one needs to get arrested for not complying to global regulations.

### Privacy: Mozilla Allegedly Violating GDPR.

Mozilla, the developer of Firefox, is facing a privacy complaint from the EU privacy rights group **Noyb**, alleging violation of GDPR by tracking Firefox users without permission through a new feature called "Privacy Preserving Attribution" (PPA). Noyb argues that this turns Firefox into a tracking tool for websites, which Mozilla calls misdirection. Noyb's complaint also accuses Mozilla of failing to inform users about the processing of their personal data and using an opt-out mechanism instead of opt-in. The privacy rights group wants the regulator to order the deletion of all data collected so far. Mozilla has responded that it has only conducted a limited test of a PPA prototype, which is easily disabled in Firefox's settings and does not collect personal data.

### Privacy: Tails Joins the Tor Project.

The Tor Project and [Tails](https://tails.net/) have merged operations. This collaboration aims to enhance sustainability, reduce overhead, and expand training and outreach programs to counter digital threats. By combining resources, they aim to strengthen their ability to protect users worldwide from surveillance and censorship, with a particular focus on improving digital security tools for activists, journalists, and everyday users. Tails will benefit of the Tor Project ecosystem in an official way and we may see improvements in the privacy focused Linux operating system.

### Techniques: Bellingcat's Online Investigations Toolkit.

Have you ever struggled to find a tool that does exactly what you need? Do you know the feeling of spending hours trying to figure out how to use a tool just to realize that the key features you are interested in are not working anymore, or that the previously free product has turned into a paid one that is more expensive than you can afford? Bellingcat shared this compilation of tools and resources to help you with online investigations, from social media to satellite imagery, they cover the most frequent resources used by investigators.

### Techniques: Online Content Similarity Search.

The Laundromat tool provides two core functions: Content Similarity Search and Metadata Similarity Search. It allows you to perform different tasks such as search for similar content across the web, check if two domains share similarities or identify if two article share the same characteristics. The tool is very valuable to perform OSINT on websites and domains but as usual, my disclaimer: any information shared with this kind of services is not private, be careful and diligent with your searches.

### Tools: CyberScrapper 2077.

A web-scrapping tool that leverages the use of LLMs (Large Language Models) to extract information from websites by using AI. It allows users to connect to external services such as OpenAI or to use local models, improving the privacy and operational security of the users.

### Tools: Kotaemon.

As you have noticed, more and more content is shared on this **eZine** related to AI. We are starting to see and increase of tools and resources for online investigations by using AI. **Kotaemon** is an AI-based tool that allows you to "chat" with your documents, extracting insights from them and providing you with enhanced information about them. It uses support commercial and local AI providers, something that is a huge privacy advantage as our information, when using local providers, is not shared with any third-party.

### Tools: SquatSquasher.

One of the most relevant techniques that we can perform when investigating infrastructure, such as domain names, is to test different combinations of letters (permutation) to see if there is other relevant content that we may be not aware of. **SquatSquasher** generates typosquated domain variations such as using the letter o instead of the number zero or the capital i (I) to replace the lower L (l). The tool also checks if the domain is registered and the IP address is resolving to.
