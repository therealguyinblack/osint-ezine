### Addons: Best Chrome Extensions for OSINT.

I-Intelligence has collected an updated an extensive list of extensions that OSINT professionals, researchers and journalists can use to enhance their ability to find, organize and use open source information.

### AI: OpenAI Voice (Deepfake) Engine.

According to an OpenAI blog post, Voice Engine is a tool for cloning people’s voices but is holding back on its public release due to concerns about possible misuse in a key election year. Voice Engine can replicate a person’s voice based on a 15-second audio sample, according to the company post demonstrating the tool. Voice cloning can be more effective and less identifiable in terms of deepfakes and misinformation and the risk to be misused is very high compared to other techniques that are still on development.

### Crypto: Ethereum Dencun Upgrade.

One of the most awaited upgrades, Dencun (Cancun-Deneb) introduced new functionalities in Layer-2 Ethereum blockchains such as "sharding" that when implemented, they will allow to reduce fees significantly in that L2's. Dencun primarily addresses scalability (handling more users and more transactions) with affordable fees, while maintaining decentralization of the network.

### Learning: Public Private Partnerships to Combat Ransomware.

This research report examines three existing public-private partnerships to combat ransomware: Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the United States Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), and the Institute for Security and Technology’s Ransomware Task Force (RTF). In selecting these cases, the goal was to highlight three separate elements of the effort to combat ransomware: criminally focused prosecution and disruption, operational collaboration, and policy measures.

### News: Facebook Spying on Snapchat.

In 2016, Facebook launched a secret project designed to intercept and decrypt the network traffic between people using Snapchat’s app and its servers. The goal was to understand users’ behavior and help Facebook compete with Snapchat, according to newly unsealed court documents. Facebook called this “Project Ghostbusters,” in a clear reference to Snapchat’s ghost-like logo.

### News: Tor Introducing WebTunnel to Fight Censorship.

The Tor Project has announced the release of a new bridge called ‘WebTunnel,’ designed to help users bypass censorship in highly problematic regions where accessing the Tor network is particularly challenging. WebTunnel functions as a pluggable transport that mimics encrypted web traffic (HTTPS) and is specifically designed to resemble WebSocket-like HTTPS connections. This enables user traffic to blend with regular web traffic, making it difficult for observers to detect that the user employs a censorship circumvention tool.
