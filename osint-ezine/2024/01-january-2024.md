### AI: AI Models Poisoning.

More news and articles are appearing about the poisoning of AI models for various purposes. From stealing development credentials to explore the infrastructure or environments where they are hosted. One of the main vectors of poisoning is attempting to remove the safety measures that some implementations, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), in their most public known form, chatbots, have in place to prevent users from obtaining answers to topics such as illegal activities or harmful behaviors.

This article describes a research endeavor aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in such LLMs.

### AI: Amazon AI Generated Products.

Amazon is selling products with AI-generated names such as "I Cannot Fulfill This Request It Goes Against Open AI Use Policy". We have read news about fake reviews generated by AI or the common use of LLMs to produce articles, but in this case, a blog post reveals that some products are being labelled based on the incorrect outputs of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

### Crypto: Amazon ECS is the new EC2 for crypto mining.

An interesting article discusses how malicious actors are infiltrating unprotected cloud services, including Amazon ECS instances, in order to deploy cryptocurrency miners. The attackers are able to obtain cryptocurrencies with ease while also consuming a disproportionate amount of resources that are otherwise available to other cloud customers.

### Crypto: When AI Meets Crypto.

Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin, discusses in this blog post a categorization of various ways in which cryptocurrency and AI could intersect, as well as the prospects and challenges associated with each category.

### News: NIST Identifies Cyberattacks That Manipulate AI Behaviors.

Adversaries can intentionally confuse or "poison" AI systems, causing them to malfunction, and there is no foolproof defense that developers can employ. Computer scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their collaborators have identified these vulnerabilities, as well as others in AI and machine learning (ML), in a new publication.

### Privacy: Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, 14 Eyes (What to Avoid in 2024).

This article is a guide on privacy and how different geopolitical alliances between nations regarding digital surveillance can impact our rights or investigations. When discussing privacy and anonymity, I aim to present both sides of the issue, considering the user perspective as well as that of law enforcement, so it's essential to be open-minded when exploring this type of content.

### Privacy: Cars are a Privacy Nightmare.

I've made an exception to provide outdated content due to its relevance and depth. The article, although from September 2023, presents a thorough investigation and review of automobile manufacturers and the privacy concerns surrounding their products.

### Privacy: Scammers Stealing People's Faces.

DeepFakes and Generative content are two areas of AI that have been increasingly exploited for illicit purposes. Recently, a high-profile example involved fake AI-generated sexual content attributed to singer Taylor Swift. This article delves into the misuse of DeepFake technology and voice cloning to create digital twins for perpetrating scams.

### Techniques: Personal Data Permutator.

This entry combines technical information with tool usage. It describes a web service that enables users to input first, middle (or nickname), last name, and year, and then generates possible search patterns and links. This technique is known as "permutation" and can be useful when an investigator lacks a clear trail or selector, providing inspiration for further exploration and progression in the investigation.

### Tools: Goosint.

Goosint is a web portal that aggregates and provides access to popular open-source intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity tools available online. The platform aims to assist users in discovering free resources for cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and OSINT, currently featuring over 130 web-enabled tools.
