### AI: International AI Safety Report 2025.

More than 100 AI experts have elaborated a must-read report on the state of advanced AI capabilities and risks. It summarises the scientific evidence on the safety of general-purpose AI to help create a shared international understanding of risks from advanced AI and how they can be mitigated. General-purpose AI, or AI that can perform a wide variety of tasks, is a type of AI that has advanced rapidly in recent years and is widely used by technology companies for a range of consumer and business purposes.

### AI: Nepenthes, the AI Eater.

Honeypots are pieces of software very well-known in the cybersecurity realm. Honeypots create fake services or applications, sometimes offering vulnerabilities, to trap malware and virus that believe on infecting a real system. An anonymous developer, tired of seeing how Facebook's web-crawler visited his website more than 30 million times, decided to take measures. AI systems such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek obtain their datasets by crawling and scrapping the Internet, sometimes, without obeying the no-scrapping rules of the websites. This developer has created **Nepenthes**, a honeypot with the solely purpose of trapping "rebel crawlers" and forcing them to dive into a void of useless data.

### AI: Pro-Israeli AI bot goes Rogue.

The _@FactFinderAI_ account, that promotes pro-Israeli content on the platform X, has gone totally out of control in the past weeks transforming into an anti-Zionism machine. The automated account started to post content contradicting its previous statements and even denying some events. It is not the first AI bot of this kind spreading Israeli propaganda but clearly, is another proof of why we still need humans behind these kind of AI bots.

### AI: The Stargate Project.

OpenAi, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, with the support of NVIDIA, ARM and Microsoft among others, have announced the creation of the Stargate Project. More than $500 billions to invest in the next four years, with an initial deployment of $100 billions to create super-computing infrastructure for the development of AI in the United States of America... in the meantime, we are still debating in Europe what can we do or not with AI...

### Learning: Common Challenges in Cybercrime.

The yearly report written jointly by Europol and Eurojust addresses both persistent and emerging challenges in the realm of cybercrime. It also reflects on different issues with regards the challenges presented and highlights several new EU legislative frameworks, such as the e-evidence Package and the Digital Services Act.

### News: eXodus.

This month of January have been very active in the X media platform. A lot of projects and users have abandoned the application and migrated to BlueSky or Mastodon, as the case of the renown Linux project Debian. Others have been forced to, as it happened to the Tor Project official account, that has been hacked. Interesting times with new actors jumping in but... it will last for longer? Is not the first time that we see eXodus attempts but shortly, users return to Musk's.

### News: General Motors Order to Stop Users Data Collection.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking action against General Motors (GM) and its subsidiary, OnStar, for unlawful collection and selling drivers precise geolocation and driving behaviour data from millions of vehicles. Specifically, FTC alleges that GM collected precise geolocation data every three seconds, as well as driving data (breaking, speeding) from millions of vehicles without obtaining the consumers' explicit consent.

### News: MasterCard Under Nigerian Control (almost).

_Philippe Caturegli_ a seasoned security researcher figured out that, since several years ago, MasterCard, one of the top financial companies worldwide, have configured wrongly one of it's DNS (domain name service) and instead of pointing to the proper **.net** domain, was pointing to **.ne** this allowed any attacker to register the Nigerian-based domain name and access to all the traffic from the company. Luckily the researcher registered the domain and informed properly to the company.

### Privacy: Subaru Location Tracking.

I do not like neither understand cars. Since I was young, my passion were computers, that's why I became a computer expert but I am very lucky that I have a relative that is my counterpart on that aspect, his passion are cars and he became a vehicle forensics expert. This month he shared with me this interesting article about how cybersecurity experts were able to hack a Subaru remotely. They could open and close the doors, track all the history of navigation but, more concerning, being able to start and stop the car. We had a very interesting conversation about what can happen if a hacker, tracks the location in real-time of the vehicle and before tracing a curve, the car suddenly shutdowns at 120kmh... you know I like horror but as usual, the present is way more horrific.

### Privacy: US Cloud EU Wall.

The new US government has introduced a lot of changes but there is one incoming legislation that can change the access and use to cloud services. With the approval of the new bill, a new provision can enter into force that is incompatible with the EU regulations on protection of personal data and may led to the impossibility for EU businesses and government agencies to use US-based Cloud services, taking into consideration that the majority of the mentioned parties rely on big companies, based on US for infrastructure such as Google, Microsoft or Amazon, it will "punch a hole" in the US-EU data deal.

### Techniques: How Trophy Videos Link Paramilitary Commanders to War Crimes in Sudan.

Impressive report by The New York Times Visual Investigations team were they explain and show, how visual evidence collected and analysed over months by The New York Times identifies the commanders leading an opaque paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, as fighters under their watch commit atrocities across Sudan.

### Techniques: The Importance of Favicons.

Favicons are the little images that display in the upper bar of the browser when visiting certain websites. Favicons have been (and still are...) a crucial piece of information when investigating certain infrastructure such as darknets websites. This article covers different techniques on how to explore favicons and to obtain relevant insights from them.

### Tools: GoSearch.

_GoSearch_ is an efficient and reliable OSINT tool designed for uncovering digital footprints and leaked passwords, across various social networks, associated with a given username.

### Tools: Obtainium.

When using a smartphone for operational purposes, high-level of security always require an Android device. One of the first-steps is to de-Google it (uninstall all Google services). _Obtainium_ is an Android alternative to the Google Store were we can download all kind of apps from trusted repositories.

### Tools: TruffleHog Explorer.

It is quite a coincidence that we are two renown experts in Spain, dedicated to cybersecurity, that share name and (almost) profile picture on LinkedIn. _@GONZOsint_ has developed and incredibly web frontend for the renown program [_TruffleHog_](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog).
