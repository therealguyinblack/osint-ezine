### AI: Leaked Memo on AI Displacing Legal Work.

A leaked internal memo suggests that OpenAI’s ChatGPT could soon displace entry-level legal staff, including junior lawyers and paralegals. The report warns of AI-driven disruption in legal services, with automation potentially reshaping how firms manage case research and client work. The leak has reignited debates on AI’s impact on employment and professional services.

### Crypto: First U.S. State-Issued Stablecoin Goes Live.

FRNT, issued on Avalanche, is the first state-backed stablecoin in the U.S. to be launched for public use. Developed in partnership with a regulated financial institution, it provides a blockchain-based alternative to traditional digital payments. Unlike pilot projects, FRNT is fully operational and marks a significant milestone in government-backed digital assets.

### Learning: OSCE Guide on Combating Online Exploitation.

The OSCE released guidance on how law enforcement and institutions can counter the use of digital technologies in trafficking and child exploitation. The report highlights trends in offenders’ use of encrypted platforms, cryptocurrencies, and AI, and provides best practices for detection, prevention, and international cooperation.

### Learning: Why AI Models Fail at Photo Verification.

In last issues of the OSINT eZine I have shared different content on how AI models were very useful in geolocation tasks but, as many of you have shared with me, is technique that not always worked having disparity of results when using different AI models. This article explains on detail and with several tests how AI model reasoning sometimes create situations were models get "confused" and follow the wrong details, missing the overall picture context.

### Learning: LLMs vs Geolocation: GPT-5 Tested.

After July's article on AI use for geolocation, Bellingcat compared leading AI models on geolocation challenges, testing 500 images across GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and others. Results showed GPT-5 performed worse than peers, particularly in precise identification tasks. The findings highlight that while LLMs are improving, human-led geolocation methods remain more reliable for investigative work.

### News: China Exploits SharePoint in Major Hack.

A ProPublica investigation details how Chinese-linked hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint to access sensitive U.S. government and corporate systems. The incident raises questions about Microsoft’s patching process and the security of widely deployed enterprise platforms.

### Privacy: Cloudflare on Perplexity’s Undeclared Crawlers.

Cloudflare reported that AI search startup Perplexity is using stealth web crawlers that evade 'robots.txt' directives and ignore website owners restrictions. The company argues this undermines web trust and raises legal questions about unauthorized scraping of content. The case adds to growing disputes between AI companies and publishers.

### Privacy: SpyVPN Secretly Captures Screens.

Researchers uncovered that SpyVPN, advertised as a privacy tool, was secretly taking screenshots of users desktops and transmitting them to external servers. The discovery highlights risks in using unverified VPN services and emphasizes the need for users to rely on transparent, audited providers.

### Techniques: Weaponizing Image Scaling Against AI.

A Trail of Bits report shows how image scaling can be exploited as an attack vector against AI systems. By inserting hidden content into images that appears benign to humans but malicious when resized, attackers can manipulate AI outputs. The findings underline the need for robust preprocessing defenses in production systems.
