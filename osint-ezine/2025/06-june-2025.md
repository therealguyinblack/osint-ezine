### AI: Bias in Law Enforcement.

A great report by the friends from Europol's Innovation Lab. It is a detailed and well explained document that highlights different biases in AI that, even focused on law enforcement, can be of relevance to other areas to better understand how our decisions and approaches can impact the outcomes or the training processes of AI models.

### AI: Disrupting Malicious uses of AI.

The latest report from OpenAI features case studies on how they are detecting and preventing malicious uses of AI. From fake IT workers (see below in the Learning section an entire article about it) exploiting AI to gain remote jobs to different cyber operations and covert campaigns but advanced threat actors.

### Crypto: Russia Teenage Spy Crypto Trail.

Russia has resorted to using untrained spies after its diplomats and operatives were expelled from Europe in response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The case against a Canadian teenager now jailed in Poland reveals how Moscow conducts the operations, and how cryptocurrency funds them.

### Defense: Operation Spiderweb.

This June, a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed billions of dollar's worth of Russian aircraft stationed at bases across the country, including at locations as far away as Siberia. The spectacular operation, known as Spiderweb, was prepared in secret over 18 months. Ukraine’s agents moved short-range drones and explosives inside Russia before they were launched remotely for a coordinated strike on that was intended to strike at Moscow’s air superiority.

### Defense: The Threat of UAVs in the Hands of Criminals.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly called drones, have radically transformed the modern battlefield but also, other criminal areas such as drug-trafficking or weapons smuggling. Domestic drones under 500€ are more than enough to impact severe damage and in this article, it is explained how these technology equipment's can be misused by Violent Non-State Actors (VNSAs).

### Learning: Fake IT Remote Workers.

This article delves into North Korean state-sponsored actors emerging as a particularly insidious challenge: fake workers. These highly skilled IT workers exploit the global demand for tech talent, operating under fraudulent identities to infiltrate companies worldwide, generate illicit revenue for their regime, and potentially engage in cyber espionage and data theft.

### Learning: Have LLMs Finally Mastered Geolocation?

Bellingcat has assessed how LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral and xAI compare today, by running 500 geolocation tests, with 20 models each analyzing the same set of 25 images. Lately has been showed how well AI models can predict countries and even very close locations of pictures without metadata to rely on. This post covers they comparison between models and gives a lot of ideas and tips to use AI in your geolocation tasks.

### Learning: Five Real-World Failures Because AI-Generated Media.

One of the "must read" of this month newsletter articles, it exposes five different cases were AI-driven disinformation, deepfakes, synthetic audio or manipulated images played a fundamental role deceiving audiences and even professional journalists it selves.

### Learning: Virtual Manipulation.

This report by NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence (StratCom COE) delves into the realm of online manipulation and examines automated messaging campaigns about NATO, the Baltics and Poland, along with Russia's broader narrative on the Alliance and online campaigns targeting Ukraine.

### News: WhatsApp banned on US House of Representatives and Ads.

Two news simultaneously that, even not linked to each other, gives a lot of food for thought on what is going on with Meta's messenger. The first one is a memo sent by the US Office of Cybersecurity informing the House of Representatives personnel of the banning from corporate devices of WhatsApp, as it happened in the past with other apps, because according to the note: "...WhatsApp has a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use."

The second article is about how Meta is introducing ads to their status screen, another source of controversy as some of this content has been generated with AI by using user-generated content from Instagram or Facebook.

### News: Germany Turns its Back on Microsoft.

Another public service transitioning to alternative software solutions, after Denmark or the French gendarmerie, now is the turn to Germany northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, that will move from Microsoft Teams to an open-source alternative more than 60000 public servants followed by another 30000 teachers in coming years.

### Privacy: Denmark Transitions to Open-Source Software.

Before the Danish government announced its move, Denmark's largest cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, had already announced plans to phase out Microsoft software and cloud services. Why? Because they're concerned about who controls European data, who sets the rules, and who can potentially cut off access to essential services in times of geopolitical tension.

### Techniques: How to Access Geoblocked Websites Without a VPN.

When I show this post coming from [@Gralhix](https://gralhix.com/), the first thing that came to my mind was "Sofia talking about proxies..." happily, I was wrong. In this post, she covers alternative approaches to access content that may be restricted based on geographic location, a practice that happens more often than what we think (try to access any major Russian news outlet from Europe...).
