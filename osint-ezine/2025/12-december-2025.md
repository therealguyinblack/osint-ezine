### Crypto: AI Agents Find Smart Contract Exploits

Anthropic describes an evaluation where AI agents attempt to exploit real-world vulnerable smart contracts across multiple EVM chains. The headline finding is that frontier models can autonomously identify exploitable issues in a controlled benchmark, reinforcing the need to treat agentic capability as both a security risk and a defensive opportunity for audits and monitoring.

### Crypto: From Dark Web Pages to Blockchain

A practitioner-oriented write-up connecting dark web intelligence to blockchain investigation workflows. Useful as a bridge piece for analysts who already work illicit market threads and want concrete pivots into on-chain attribution, wallet clustering, and transactional context without over relying on a single data source.

### Learning: Chinese Malware Delivery Domains Part IV

DomainTools continues its series mapping a large-scale malware delivery ecosystem, reporting over 1,900 additional malicious domains and an expanding “super cluster”. The piece is valuable for infrastructure-focused defenders because it highlights patterns in lures, deployment scale, and how registrars, hosting, and domain churn are used to sustain operations.

### Learning: Christmas Tycoon

A case-study investigation that starts from a phishing attempt and expands into infrastructure fingerprinting across a large domain set. It is a practical example of how a single lead can scale into campaign mapping, and why URL rewriting and “secure link” services can complicate email triage and tracking.

### Learning: Cloudflare Radar 2025 Year in Review

Cloudflare publishes its annual view of global Internet patterns, disruptions, and security-relevant trends observed across its network. The report is useful for OSINT and incident context because it provides macro signals on outages, traffic shifts, and ecosystem changes that can support timelines and attribution hypotheses.

### Learning: Inside Discord OSINT Guide

A practical guide to investigating Discord, focusing on discovery, search approaches, and the OPSEC pitfalls that can compromise an investigation quickly. Helpful for teams treating Discord as a source of early indicators, community mobilization, and niche threat actor signaling.

### Learning: OSINT Year in Review Report

ShadowDragon’s year-in-review frames OSINT as operational infrastructure for enterprise and government risk work, reflecting a broader shift in how teams resource and formalize open-source collection. Even if you disagree with the vendor lens, it is a solid prompt for capability planning: staffing, tooling, legal review, and defensible workflows.

### Learning: They Droned Back

An investigation describing how journalists tracked suspicious freighters off the Dutch and German coast and linked activity to drone incidents near military sites. A good reminder that maritime OSINT, AIS anomalies, and local reporting can combine into a compelling narrative when handled carefully and corroborated.

### News: Lead Gen Database Exposes LinkedIn-Derived Records

Cybernews reports an exposed database containing billions of records and terabytes of professional data associated with lead generation. For defenders and investigators, the practical impact is predictable: more targeted spearphishing, impersonation, and social engineering using employment history, contact details, and relationship mapping.

### Privacy: End of Fingerprinting As We Know It

A threat-research discussion on how browser privacy protections are reducing the reliability of traditional fingerprinting signals. This matters for both defenders and privacy practitioners: bot detection is being forced towards server-side and behavioural signals, while the overall tracking surface is shifting, not disappearing.

### Privacy: Surveillance Under Surveillance Map

A project that visualises surveillance-related OpenStreetMap entries not typically surfaced in default OSM views, encouraging contributors to map cameras and related infrastructure. It is useful for situational awareness and research, but also highlights the dual-use nature of openly published surveillance metadata.

### Privacy: Urban VPN Extension Harvests AI Conversations

A report alleging that a popular “privacy” browser extension ecosystem collected and exported AI chat prompts and responses at scale. For OPSEC, the lesson is simple: extensions can see far more than users expect, and “VPN” branding does not equal trustworthy handling of sensitive text typed into AI tools.

### Techniques: Bellingcat Style SAR Ship Tracking Tool

A step-by-step tutorial on recreating a Bellingcat-style SAR ship detection workflow using Sentinel radar imagery. This is a strong applied piece for investigators working maritime questions where optical imagery is unavailable due to clouds, darkness, or timing gaps.

### Techniques: Financial OSINT Tracing Corporate Assets

A methodology-focused guide for tracing corporate assets and networks using public registries and structured approaches. Particularly relevant for sanctions research, fraud work, and due diligence, where beneficial ownership and indirect control often sit behind layered entities.

### Techniques: Inside the Black Box Redaction Failures

A reminder that visual masking in documents is not the same as true redaction, and that underlying text can remain recoverable. This is a recurring operational failure in legal and investigative contexts, and it is worth adding to evidence-handling checklists and training.

### Techniques: Lazarus IT Workers Scheme Live on Camera

ANY.RUN and partners describe observing a North Korea-linked IT worker infiltration workflow, including tooling and tradecraft used to sustain access. The value here is defensive: understanding hiring pipeline abuse, remote access patterns, and how “legitimate” developer environments can be weaponised.

### Techniques: Wikipedia Signs of AI Writing

A community-maintained list of stylistic and structural indicators often associated with LLM-generated text. It is not a forensic detector, but it can help editors and analysts develop a review checklist and reduce “automation bias” when assessing questionable content.

### Tools: Ghost Eye Recon Tool

A Python-based information gathering and reconnaissance tool intended for domain or IP triage. If you test it, keep usage legal and authorized, and treat outputs as leads that still require validation.

[https://github.com/BullsEye0/ghost\_eye](https://github.com/BullsEye0/ghost_eye)

***

### Tools: OSINT LLM Investigation Assistant

A Hugging Face Space positioned as an OSINT investigation assistant that generates methodologies and tool recommendations from a curated tool database. Potentially useful for drafting repeatable playbooks, but treat outputs as suggestions, not an authoritative workflow.

[https://huggingface.co/spaces/tomvaillant/osint-llm](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tomvaillant/osint-llm)

***

### Tools: Waybien Community Search Engine

A community search engine indexing groups and channels across platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Facebook. For investigators, tools like this can accelerate discovery, but you should still verify membership context, moderation posture, and false positives before acting on results.
