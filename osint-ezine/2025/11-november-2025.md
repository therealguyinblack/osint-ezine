### News: OpenAI Prepares Ads for ChatGPT

A leak suggests OpenAI is moving toward introducing advertisements in ChatGPT for public users. The report outlines expected formats, integration points and the potential impact on user trust and product direction. It is not surprising as it is very widely known that if a product is free, you are the product so due the high requirements that AI platforms needs to operate, they need to start obtaining revenue from free tiers.
