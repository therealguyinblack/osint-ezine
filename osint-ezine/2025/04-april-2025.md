### AI: DeepSpeak Free Dataset.

High quality data is one of the most important requirements of AI technologies. The possibility to work with such content improves the outcome of the models and how they provide information and interact with end users. The DeepSpeak Dataset v2.0 contains over 52 hours of real and deepfake footage of people talking and gesturing in front of their webcams. The source data was collected from a diverse set of participants in their natural environments and the deepfakes were generated using state-of-the-art open-source avatar, lip-sync, and face-swap software.

### AI: How Crawlers Impact the Operations of the Wikimedia.

Since the beginning of 2024, the demand for the content created by the Wikimedia volunteer community, especially for the 144 million images, videos, and other files on Wikimedia Commons, has grown significantly. This post discuss the reasons for this trend and its impact. If you are wondering if AI is behind... this entry is in the proper category ;)

### Crypto: AMLTRIX.

AMLTRIX is an open, community-driven knowledge framework designed to document and standardize how financial criminals operate. Inspired by adversarial models in cybersecurity, it breaks down money laundering into distinct tactics, techniques, and indicators, offering a structured, machine-readable way to understand, detect, and mitigate illicit financial activity. Whether you're an AML analyst, data scientist, regulator, or investigator, AMLTRIX helps you map real-world behavior to clear, actionable insights.

### Crypto: MiCAR, Monero and the Concept of Decentralisation.

The European Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) introduced several articles with an indirect impact on cryptocurrency projects like Monero. "Fully decentralised" crypto-asset offerings (activities, products, or services), without any intermediary, were exempt from the regulation. Seems like a win for decentralised projects? The issue is that that the term ‘fully decentralised’ has not been clearly defined, casting doubt on how to interpret and apply the regulation.

### Learning: Be Careful What You OSINT With.

An updated version of a previous article, the author emphasises how important is to know our tools but more important, who is behind them. It provides a detailed investigation on who is behind one of the most known tools currently, Lampyre, and how his approach can be applied to any other tool we need, and should vet before real-world use.

### Learning: OSINT Techniques.

We are seeing an increase demand of OSINT analysts to cover different business areas. From journalism to business intelligence or financial institutions, the power of open source information and how to transform all the data acquired into actionable intelligence is more and more relevant. This post by our _OSINT Yoda_, Nico Dekens, covers briefly multiple aspects and techniques of this expertise. Geolocation; Social Media Analysis; Public Records Research... a vast source of knowledge to dive in.

### Learning: The Role of DNS in Investment Scams.

This report provides insights of several investment scam actors who lure victims with fake platforms, including crypto exchanges. Fake websites referred to as “profit platforms” are designed to convince users they are dealing with a legitimate business and this post explores what techniques and also, infrastructure are abused for such activity.

### Learning: The Slow Collapse of Critical Thinking in OSINT due to AI.

_OSINT used to be a thinking game. Now it’s becoming a trusting game and that should terrify you._ With this words, this article provides readers with material to think and reflect about the increasing over-presence of AI in all processes, critical thinking and decision making being some of them.

### Privacy: Sweden’s Tax Authority Accused of Selling People’s Data to Advertisers.

The Austrian-based privacy group _noyb_ has filed a lawsuit against Sweden's Tax Agency, accusing it of illegally selling citizens personal information to data brokers, a practice it says violates both national and EU data protection laws.

### Techniques: AI Geolocation.

A new competitor for the geolocation exercises of my good friend Sofia Santos (_@Gralhix_) has appear lately with the capability to identify the location of images in a swift and quite accurate fashion. ChatGPT's newest models (o3 and o4-mini) seemed to be very helpful with regards identifying images location without analysing metadata. This two articles explores the different results that experts and hobbyists of geolocation games achieve by using ChatGPT.

### Techniques: Preventing Typosquatting.

Typosquatting is a common technique were malicious actors register a domain with a similar name to an official one, to confuse users and perform harmful activities. The domain "amazon.com" can be impersonated by using a visually similar domain like the case of "amazоn.com". In this previous example, the letter "**о**" between the _z_ and _n_ in "z**o**n" is not a regular "о", is the Cyrillic version that makes it a total different character but visually identical. This website allows to check if given a domain, there are variations of it's name that can led to confusion.

### Techniques: Spotting Deepfakes.

Generative AI technologies, particularly the ones creating images and video, are achieving great levels of quality with every new model released. The task of determining what is real and what is not is becoming more and more challenging. This article shares the outcome of a study trying to determine the best tools currently available to identify AI-generated media.

### Techniques: The Role of Domain and DNS Intelligence in Fighting Online Threats.

DNS is the backbone for Internet communications. It translates IP addresses to domain names and facilitate the interaction between users and systems. Such a relevant piece is as well, one of the main leads we have, when conducting online investigations, to gather information about possible online threats. This article explains in detail how DNS can be used for malicious campaigns and how investigators and analysts can explore them.
