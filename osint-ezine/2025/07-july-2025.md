### AI: AI-Powered Translations on Terrorism.

The webpage discusses how terrorist organizations, particularly the Islamic State (IS), are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to produce and disseminate propaganda. One specific case study involves the use of Whisper from OpenAI, a free and open-source AI model, to translate and transcribe Arabic audio into English, making IS propaganda more accessible to a wider audience. The authors emphasize the need for security agencies to develop counter-terrorism responses that incorporate effective tools to limit the creation of AI-generated content and the diffusion of propaganda.

### AI: DeepSeek First EU Bans.

German and Czech governments have banned the use of DeepSeek in public administration. One of the main competitors of the American-based ChatGPT, DeepSeek provides a free alternative with quality results very close to the main player by OpenAI. The links of DeepSeek with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the legal enforcement of sharing information with the Chinese intelligence services poses this service as critical when using government data on it.

### Crypto: Mapping the Money Multiverse.

This article discusses the evolving money landscape, exploring various forms of money and financial assets, from traditional cash and bank deposits to digital and virtual assets such as stablecoins, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and cryptocurrencies. It maps the different categories along two axes: issuer spectrum (state-issued vs. private or decentralized issuance) and purpose (general-purpose money vs. specialized utility).

### Crypto: MITRE AADAPT.

MITRE is widely known for their cybersecurity framework named ATT\&CK. It covers multiple angles on cybersecurity for protection and investigation and lately, they have developed AADAPT. Adversarial Actions in Digital Asset Payment Technologies is a comprehensive knowledge base that outlines adversary tactics and techniques for digital asset management systems, derived from real-world attacks, observations, and vulnerabilities.

### Learning: Are your Passwords in the Green?

How effective and unbreakable are your passwords? The chart on this website estimates how long it would take a hacker to crack a password using various hashing algorithms and hardware configurations. The table is based on the latest data breaches and uses bcrypt with a work factor of 10, which is considered a more secure option. The author also addresses common questions and misconceptions about password security, such as the effectiveness of dictionary attacks and the use of special characters in passwords.

### Learning: RDAP and BGP in Investigative Journalism.

Networks and infrastructure investigations are one of the main means to acquire information in multiple areas. Not only criminal cases can be enriched by focusing on infrastructure, investigative journalism, financial investigations and the most relevant field taking advantage of this area, cyberthreat intelligence, can benefit from understanding this essential part of the technology. This post shows some techniques and approaches to take advantage of information that is usually totally open source.

### News: Swedish Prime Minister Location Leaked... Strava.

An another case of privacy leaks by relevant public people... this time is the case of Sweden prime minister that via its bodyguards, it has been possible to geolocate years of activity thanks to the sport app Strava. Never forget to check it out because the data that can be found on it, mainly geolocation, is one of the most previous and valuable ones.

### Privacy: How Chinese Apps Ignore GDPR.

TikTok, AliExpress, and WeChat are facing different complaints for failing to comply with access requests under Article 15 GDPR. The companies have been unable to provide users with complete and understandable access to their personal data, violating EU law. This is part of a larger series of complaints against Chinese tech companies for unlawful data transfers to China.

### Privacy: 123456, The Password to Access Hiring Data.

Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered a security vulnerability in McDonald's AI job hiring chatbot, McHire, which exposed the personal data of 64 million job applicants. The issue was caused by a simple password, "123456", which allowed access to applicants' names, email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers. The vulnerability was resolved within a few hours after the researchers' report but this incident highlights the importance of robust security measures in AI-powered systems.

### Techniques: Reddit Resources.

Reddit is one of the platforms-to-go when monitoring worldwide events. It can provide very diverse information like links to additional websites or media attachments. This blog post presents several techniques and a compilation of tools to gather an analyse as much data as possible in an effective way from Reddit.

### Tools: Impersonal.me

impersonal.me is a powerful localized Google search tool that lets you see search results from different countries and languages without changing your actual location or using a VPN. By simulating searches from specific regions with authentic country and language parameters, you can view exactly what users in those locations see when they search Google.

### Tools: Lumo-AI by Proton.

Proton has launched their own AI-assistant called Lumo. The biggest different with their competitors is that, as the rest of the Proton suite, no data is stored or used for training purposes making Lumo one of the unique assistants that are totally private. Nevertheless, I would never use an AI-tool for personal/sensitive uses but Lumo comes backed with the privacy reputation that all the rest of Proton products have.
