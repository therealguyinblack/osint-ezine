### AI: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations.

NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology have published a report on "Trustworthy and Responsible AI" that provides a taxonomy of concepts and defines terminology in the field of adversarial machine learning (AML). The taxonomy is arranged in a conceptual hierarchy that includes key types of ML methods, life cycle stages of attack, and attacker goals, objectives, capabilities, and knowledge. This report also identifies current challenges in the life cycle of AI systems and describes corresponding methods for mitigating and managing the consequences of those attacks.

### AI: Pinterest will Train AI Models on User Data.

Pinterest will train AI models on user data and content, regardless of when it was posted. According to a new clause in their privacy policy, the use of user-generated content will be used to develop and train their new models, even if the data has been already posted.

### Crypto: Fake Crypto Tokens.

Fake crypto tokens are a common type of cryptocurrency scam where malicious actors create counterfeit tokens that mimic legitimate cryptocurrencies. These scams often involve fake Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), airdrops, and pump and dump schemes, which can lead to significant financial losses for investors. In this blog post, Binance provides some tips and advice to protect your assets.

### Learning: Cryptocurrency and Extremism.

Cryptocurrencies have become attractive for extremist fundraising due to their decentralized nature, allowing groups to transcend borders, sanctions, and regulations. Between 2012 and 2024, extremist groups received over $21 million in cryptocurrencies, with European white supremacist/nationalist groups experiencing a 270% increase in average cryptocurrency deposits between 2023 and 2024. The use of cryptocurrencies by extremist groups is often linked to their perceived anonymity, ease of use, and ability to evade law enforcement, making them a viable option for groups seeking to circumvent traditional financial systems. This post explores how SNA (Social Network Analysis) can be applied to cluster and detect links and interactions between entities.

### Learning: EU-SOCTA.

The EU Serious and Organized Crime Threat Assessment (EU-SOCTA) is a report by Europol that updates the European law enforcement community on serious and organized crime threats to the EU. The report identifies high-priority crime areas that the EU operational response should focus on, using a mixed-method approach involving qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques. The EU-SOCTA 2025 report assesses key threats of serious and organized crime in the EU, providing recommendations for priority setting in the fight against such crimes. The report also highlights the changing nature of serious and organized crime, including new variations in criminal activity and the exploitation of legislative loopholes and the internet.

### Learning: Global Terrorism Index 2025.

The Institute for Economics & Peace published a dedicated report on global terrorism trends that cover the period of 2024. The report dives into the insights of topics such as trends in terrorism, geographical groups in areas like The Sahel or international terrorist groups like Islamic State and it's affiliates.

### News: Apple's App Store Alternatives.

People in the European Union are now allowed to access alternative app stores thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), a regulation designed to foster increased competition in the app ecosystem. Like Apple’s App Store, alternative app marketplaces allow for easy access to a wider world of apps, but instead of the apps going through Apple’s App Review process, the apps on these third-party marketplaces have to go through a notarization process to ensure they meet some “baseline platform integrity standards” Apple says, like being malware-free. However, each store can review and approve apps according to its own policies. The stores are also responsible for any matters relating to support and refunds, not Apple.

### News: Tornado Cash Delisting.

The US Treasury has removed economic sanctions against Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer, due to novel legal and policy issues. However, the Treasury remains concerned about the use of digital assets for malicious activities, particularly by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The trial of its co-founder is still ongoing, as it is related to money laundering, but this step opens the door to a new legal paradigm in the US that can be reflected in other jurisdictions such as the EU.

### Privacy: Cloudflare AI labyrinth.

In the newsletter issue of January ([_#47_](https://therealguyinblack.gitbook.io/osint-ezine/osint-ezine/2025/01-january-2025#ai-nepenthes-the-ai-eater)) I shared a tool called **Nepenthes** that was a honeypot to block AI crawlers and lure them to an endless nightmare of random data. Cloudflare, the web infrastructure provider, has implemented a very similar solution at large-scale called "AI Labyrinth". This feature detects AI crawlers and redirects them to a "trap" that provides them more AI generated content, the main goal of this feature is to combat unauthorized AI data scraping to protect consumers content that don't want to be used as training data for such AI system.

### Privacy: Docs, the European alternative to Google Docs.

French and German governments recently announced Docs, a collaborative writing and information-sharing service designed for use on the cloud or offline. Positioned as a potential alternative to Google Docs, Outline, and similar tools, Docs emphasizes "simplicity" and security for EU professionals looking to move away from US-made products.

### Techniques: A Magic Trick for Pinterest.

The OSINTer **Griffin Glynn** aka _@hatless1der_, has shared a technique for Pinterest that can be useful to try to enumerate emails from usernames on the social media platform. Taking advantage of seamless integrations of services such as Gmail, sometimes, as this is not only valid for Pinterest, we can trace back the email address of a given username.

### Techniques: Domain Registrars Powering Russian Disinformation.

This blog post explains, in a very detailed way, how Russian disinformation actors use domains to promote and disseminate disinformation but also, how domains are use for other illegal purposes like typosquatting or homoglyph attacks. The blog also details what are the main domain registrars that these groups prefer to launch their campaigns.
