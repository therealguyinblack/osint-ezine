### AI: Google Back to AI Military Developments.

Google removed a pledge to not build AI for weapons or surveillance from its website this month. The change was first spotted by Bloomberg. The company appears to have updated its public AI principles page, erasing a section titled “applications we will not pursue,” which was still included as recently as last January.

### AI: OmniHuman-1, a DeepFake Factory.

OmniHuman-1 is the new AI framework from the company ByteDance (TikTok), that allows its users to generate incredibly realistic human videos from just a single image and a motion signal like an audio or a video. According to the videos shared on their website, the first glimpses of this technology are impressive and the possibility to generate hyper-realistic DeepFakes is more affordable every day.

### AI: Regulatory Sandboxes.

Currently in the EU, more and more AI sandboxes are being deployed and operational for different purposes such as test new models or develop new compliance tools. This whitepaper presents a comprehensive examination of regulatory sandboxes for AI and cybersecurity.

### AI: US Bill to Ban Chinese Models.

"Decoupling America's Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act of 2025". That is the exact name of the bill that has been presented in The United States and that tries to ban and restrict the use of AI models from China like DeepSeek with penalties up to 20 years of imprisonment.

### Crypto: Criminal Use of Cryptocurrency Manual.

A complete guide, that contains the basics of cryptocurrencies; criminal use; crypto investigations or international cooperation, covering the full-spectrum of content needed for any investigator to get the basics of this field that is more and more on the spotlight of many online investigations.

### Crypto: TRM 2025 Crypto Crime Report.

The 2025 Crypto Crime Report from TRM Labs reveals how the landscape of illicit cryptocurrency activity has evolved over the past year. In 2024, illicit crypto volume declined by 24%, yet ransomware payments soared to record highs. Terrorist financing through digital assets expanded, while scams and fraud remained a significant threat. And meanwhile, North Korea-linked hacks continued, with nearly USD 800 million in cryptocurrency stolen in 2024.

### Learning: How to Use Conflict Zone Information in Terrorism Trials.

The aim of this manual is to help practitioners carry out their investigations and prosecutions of crimes of terrorism and other related crimes – including violations of international humanitarian law - committed in the context of armed conflicts. It provides detailed information about different aspects of the process of gathering information and contains helpful resources applicable to other areas as it covers different working environments like physical; digital; documentary or satellite.

### Learning: OSINTCon 2025.

The agenda is still pending confirmation but this OSINT conference, would take place in May and it will be free and online, a perfect opportunity to gather knowledge and learn new techniques and work ways.

### News: Apple Pulls Data Protection Tool After UK Government Security Row.

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a controversial topic. It allows privacy to its users but is a technology heavily abuse by criminals so there is balance that would need to be achieved at some point. Apple is taking the unprecedented step of removing its highest level data security tool from customers in the UK, after the government demanded access to user data. A similar approach was demanded to Signal by Swedish authorities but in that case, the reply from the company was that they will leave the country before creating a vulnerability on its infrastructure.

### News: Bye Whois, Welcome RDAP.

The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) its operational and it will be the new service to manage and store data related to generic top-level domain names. Since the early stages of the Internet, Whois was the main "database" to store and manage that information. With the implementation of RDAP, new compliance and regulatory mechanisms will ease the auditing function of these services.

### Privacy: Network Security Issues in RedNote.

February has been the month of auditing with regards Chinese technology. I was very surprised of the amount of audits and reviews performed by experts to the AI model DeepSeek or the social media app RedNote, I wish the same emphasis was put in auditing other major apps that are not Chinese. RedNote was one of the most downloaded apps in February as a possible substitute of TikTok as at the beginning of the month, it was going to be banned in the US. This audit report triggers some concerns about the app that shares similarities with regards permissions required or data collected to other apps that are way more used and known.

### Privacy: The EU’s Digital Competitiveness Is at Stake.

In September 2023, the EU Commission designated the first gatekeepers, which then had to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) by March 7, 2024. However, even more than nine months later, there has been little change in the gatekeepers’ behavior: despite investigations for non-compliance, certain companies continue to rely on pseudo solutions to circumvent the law. This is stifling innovation in the EU and making it impossible for SMEs to grow.

### Techniques: A 15-year Old Hacker Geolocating Users in Signal, Discord or X.

At first when I noticed this article/guide, I thought it was a clickbait. I was expecting an exploit of the kind: send a file to your suspect and boom, geolocated... but I was completely wrong. @hackermondev, Daniel, claims to be 15 years old and it explained and proved, successfully, how due a glitch in the ~~Matrix~~ Cloudflare, it was able to geolocate uses in multiple platforms such as Signal or Discord.

### Techniques: A Malicious OSINT Extension.

On February 15, 2025, a Firefox extension called Osint Sync was distributed across several Discord communities, presented as a legitimate OSINT tool. However, investigations quickly revealed that it was actually a malware designed to collect information and monitor users’ actions within the tool.

### Techniques: AI Prompt Jailbreak.

A GitHub repository that contains, ordered by model name, different prompts that can be used to bypass certain restrictions that AI models have implemented by default.

### Techniques: Watches of Espionage.

I am extremely happy every time that I find a post or a blog with an investigation approach that is totally unconventional and unknown to me. This time is dedicated to an entire website focused on analyzing luxury watches owned by relevant individuals. The post depicts "the collection" by a rebel leader that turned Syrian president, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.

### Tools: LinkdTime.

LinkdTime is a Timeline generator for LinkedIn it can extract the exact date and time on a single post/comments or activity or generate a Timeline about a list of post/comments or activity

### Tools: lla.

lla is a modern `ls` replacement that transforms how developers interact with their filesystem. Built with Rust's performance capabilities and designed with user experience in mind, lla combines the familiarity of ls with powerful features like specialized views, Git integration, and a robust plugin system with an extensible list of plugins to add more functionality.

### Tools: Tookie.

The main idea of Tookie-osint is to discover usernames that are requested from an input. Tookie-osint is similar to the tool called Sherlock. It discovers all the user accounts across different websites and Tookie-osint is successful at this task almost 80% of the time.

### Web3: Openvibe.

A decentralized application that aims to condensate multiple apps in one place, particularly: Mastodon, Bluesky, Nostr or Threads. One of the benefits of applications that share the same protocols, like the case of the so-called Fediverse, is interoperability. Openvibe is an example of the benefits of the use of such open protocols.
