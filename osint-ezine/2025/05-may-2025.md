### AI: Closing the Digital Divide in AI.

Scholars find that large language models suffer a digital divide: The ChatGPTs and Geminis of the world work well for the 1.52 billion people who speak English, but they underperform for the world’s 97 million Vietnamese speakers, and even worse for the 1.5 million people who speak the Uto-Aztecan language Nahuatl. This article explores what is the impact and why this issue matters.

### AI: Deepfakes Avoiding Detection Mechanisms.

The increase realistic quality on AI-generated videos is making more complex the task to detect Deepfakes. Technologies that are able to detect them rely on different techniques, being one of them the detection of heartbeats in the subject. Some detection technologies analyse the subtle change of color in the skin that is associated with the heartbeats but new Deepfake generators are3 taking this into account and now they are also mimicking the heartbeats from the source video to increase their quality.

### AI: What's the Carbon Footprint of Using ChatGPT?

The use of AI has generated a lot of controversy lately about the carbon footprint that every search or interaction has. This article provides figures about energy and carbon footprints comparing them with regular numbers such as transport or household.

### Crypto: Coinbase 20 Million Spoofing Scheme.

Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange with over 100 million customers, has disclosed that cybercriminals working with rogue support agents stole customer data and demanded a $20 million ransom not to publish the stolen information. I am a content moderator for the Ethereum.org Discord server and I see every day, several attempts to scam users on different crypto-projects impersonating all kind of entities, from crypto exchangers to government entities.

### Crypto: Houthis’ Multibillion-Dollar Financial Networks.

Yemen-based Ansar Allah, widely known as the Houthis, continues to have a profound impact on global security. The group’s ongoing operations in the Red Sea affected an estimated US $1 trillion worth of maritime cargo between October 2023 and May 2024, and despite periodic kinetic attacks, its operations show no signs of abating. This article explores the Houthis’ financing mechanisms, including leveraging technology to evade sanctions and the involvement of foreign facilitators with demonstrable and plausible ties to foreign governments.

### Defense: How Tethered Drones Works.

Imagine drones that can fly indefinitely, resist jamming and deliver secure real-time video without ever worrying about battery life. Tethered drones do exactly that and they are becoming essential for crowd monitoring, emergency response and front-line defense. Open source intelligence originates from multiple sources and the imagery obtained by drones can be crucial for multiple tasks. In this post I delve into the topic of tethered drones and their dual-use potential.

### Learning: How Messaging Apps Handle Encrypted Chat Backups.

Encrypted chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp are one of the best ways to keep your digital conversations as private as possible. But if you’re not careful with how those conversations are backed up, you can accidentally undermine your privacy. This article explores the main messaging apps and how backups are managed.

### Learning: OSINT Exercises.

The best way to practise your OSINT skills is to conduct real investigations. To be hands-on in a case and follow the leads while immersing in data is the ideal environment to grow your expertise but this, is not always possible or the case so in this post from ShadowDragon, we are presented with multiple resources like tools, websites or useful links to learn or improve our skills.

### News: Long Life to Skype.

Microsoft acquired Skype in May 2011, paying $8.5 billion, and used it to replace its cross-platform instant messaging client, Windows Live Messenger. Skype was for many years the de-facto program to make voice and video calls and even till last month, with the increasing use of other solutions like Zoom or WebEx, Skype kept a high quota of users. From May, Skype has transitioned to Microsoft Team, putting and end to another golden era of well design and functional products.

### Privacy: Apple Offers VPNs With Ties to Chinese Military.

I have emphasised several times on this eZine the relevance of doing your own research and vetting process regarding tools, processes and technologies. It is vital to know what your tools are doing, where the data is going or who can access it and this is quite important when talking about network traffic. This article explores how different VPN apps, sometimes developed by front-companies, have ties with Chinese military elements and the implications that it's use can have.

### Privacy: Microsoft Recall Spying on You... Again.

Signal, the privacy messenger, has updated it's Windows version to prevent taking screenshots from the app. I read the article with curiosity because I was wondering, why Windows and why screenshots? Then I discovered the Windows launched again "Windows Recall", a failed feature now back that takes screenshots of your desktop at regular intervals to help other apps. I will not enter into the details of this feature but as we always know, taking screenshots of your activity and storing in the computer it doesn't sound good.

### Privacy: Protect Against Traffic Analysis.

That product that appears in your feed repeatedly, that same ad chasing you across social media... all this is cause because traffic data profiling among other causes (like fingerprinting). This article explains how traffic analysis works and what you can do to reduce or prevent it.

### Techniques: How Scammers Are Exploiting Generative AI.

According to data from Chainabuse, TRM Lab’s open-source fraud reporting platform, reports of generative artificial intelligence (genAI)-enabled scams between May 2024 and April 2025 rose by 456%, compared with the same period in 2023-24, which had already seen a 78% increase over 2022-23. This illustrates how the explosion in genAI tools in the past few years has led to a surge in AI-enabled fraud.

### Tools: JustDeleteMe.

Delete your account from an online service sometimes gets you into a maze of options, faq threads and online searches. JustDeleteMe is an opensource project that compiles direct links from online service providers, to make it easy the process to delete an account.
