### What is the difference between a Metaverse and a Virtual World? <a href="#ember54" id="ember54"></a>

A couple of weeks ago, Apple unveiled its first-generation Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) headset, the Vision Pro. This standalone computer, powered by the impressive M2 chipset, promises to offer a whole new level of experience to its users. While I won't delve into the technical details of this device, it's worth noting that many of the technologies present in the Vision Pro could potentially be implemented by its competitors if they choose to offer a product at a similar price point, 3599$ at this time.

In the wake of Apple's announcement, I found myself engaged in a recurring conversation about Apple's iMetaverse. Each time, my response has remained the same: it's not a Metaverse; it's a Virtual World. This led to a subsequent question that forms the basis of this post:

_What is the difference between a Metaverse and a Virtual World?_

<br>

#### Metaverse. <a href="#ember59" id="ember59"></a>

A Metaverse is an open 3D world where users can interact with one another and the environment. User interaction within a Metaverse is facilitated through virtual reality (VR) technologies, which represent users with avatars. Additionally, the actions performed within this 3D world persist even when the users are not connected, allowing for a persistent experience. Metaverses are typically open and decentralized, enabling anyone to contribute to their development, with no restrictions or specific requirements such as dedicated devices or specific social media accounts.

However, it's important to note that the Metaverse is still in its early stages of development, and currently, we only have proto-metaverses that provide similar experiences.

<br>

#### Virtual Worlds. <a href="#ember63" id="ember63"></a>

On the other hand, Virtual Worlds share certain similarities with Metaverses, which sometimes leads to confusion. In a Virtual World, users interact with each other using avatars, but it does not necessarily require the use of virtual reality technologies. Virtual Worlds may not be open and can restrict developers access to content creation or the implementation of new features.

<br>

#### Examples of Metaverses and Virtual Worlds. <a href="#ember66" id="ember66"></a>

To provide some context, here are a few notable platforms that fall into these categories:

**Decentraland** ([https://decentraland.org](https://decentraland.org/)):

Decentraland is a Metaverse. Users can immerse themselves in a 3D world with or without the use of virtual reality technology. Avatars enable interaction between users and the environment. It is an open Metaverse, allowing anyone to create designs, buildings, and even running nodes to support the infrastructure. Decentraland is based on blockchain technologies and governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

<br>

**Horizon Worlds** ([https://meta.com/horizon-worlds](https://meta.com/horizon-worlds)):

Horizon Worlds is a Virtual World. In Horizon Worlds, users can immerse themselves in a 3D world using virtual reality technologies. The key difference here is that the environment is fully proprietary and owned by Meta. Developers have limited freedom to contribute to various parts of the Virtual World, and users require a Facebook account to access it.

<br>

**Roblox** and **Minecraft** ([https://roblox.com](https://roblox.com/), [https://minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/)):

<br>

These two popular video games offer Virtual Worlds to their users. The gaming sector and the concept of the Metaverse are closely intertwined. For instance, World of Warcraft has been providing gamers worldwide with a Virtual World experience for over two decades. While the use of virtual reality technology is more limited in these cases, users still enjoy the freedom to create and implement new functionalities. However, experiences created by users in Roblox and Minecraft are typically independent of those created by other users.

<br>

#### In conclusion <a href="#ember78" id="ember78"></a>

With its latest product, the Vision Pro, Apple has introduced its first-generation virtual reality device, which promises to enrich our digital lives with new experiences. However, it is important to note that Apple's offering aligns more closely with the concept of a Virtual World, as do other industry players such as Microsoft Mesh and Meta Horizon Worlds.

The Metaverse remains in a nascent stage of development, but thanks to advancements in fields like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and IoT, we may witness early versions sooner than expected. Currently, open Metaverses like Decentraland and The Sandbox are leading the charge in shaping the future of this exciting concept.

<br>

Let's embrace this evolving landscape and eagerly anticipate the possibilities that the Metaverse holds for our interconnected digital future!
