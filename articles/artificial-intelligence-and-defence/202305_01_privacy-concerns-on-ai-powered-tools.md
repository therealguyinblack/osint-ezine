# 202305\_01\_Privacy-concerns-on-AI-powered-tools

The use of AI is becoming more omnipresent every day. Since last year, an impressive number of online tools and AI-powered services are invading our life with solutions to almost any kind of problem, from identifying plant diseases and pests (_agrio.app_) to generate meal plans for your week (_prospre.io_); a translator tool to help people understand legal language (_legalrobot.com_) or a composer that generates royalty free music for your creations (_beatoven.ai_).

When accessing this kind of service, it is crucial to consider the privacy implications associated with their usage.

These services typically require users to upload their data, which is then used for training purposes. A picture of a sick plant; the old black and white familiar portrait that we want to bring back in colorful detail; how we would look like if we had long hair and an endless list of services that require our input.

The Privacy policy of this services usually includes articles such as:

_**Information we collect.**_

_**x. Information that you give us directly, including:**_

_**Any information that you enter into any of {the service, app...} applications...**_

<br>

_**Use of the Information we Collect**_

_**x. {the service, app...} uses the information we collect to:**_

_**…**_

_**Provide our services to you.**_

_**Analyze application usage to improve the user experience.**_

_**Share with third parties for analytics and advertising purposes.**_

_**…**_

It is important to recognize that this data may include sensitive information that users may not want to be shared or used for purposes beyond their control. Additionally, it is critical to understand how this data is being used and who has access to it. The ubiquitous “third parties” term is never defined so it is very difficult for the users to identify with which parties its information is really being shared.:

<br>

_**Intellectual Property Rights**_

_**All intellectual property rights, such as the copyrights and trademark rights relating to the Service and the programs that constitute the Service, belong to {the service, app...}.**_

_**You grant {the service, app...} a worldwide, non-exclusive, free, sub-licensable and assignable license to freely utilize all intellectual property rights concerning music created using the Service (including use, reproduction, distribution, creation of derivative works, display, publication, adaptation, making transmittable and demonstration)**_

One concern is that uploaded data could potentially be used for the training of algorithms that may not align with the user's values or ethical standards. A vast majority of applications imply the uploading of pictures of the users, without clear definitions about the composition of the third parties as mentioned above or the real use after the upload of the content data could be used to train algorithms for surveillance or other purposes that users may not consent to.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential to ensure that web services that provide AI-powered tools have robust privacy policies and data protection measures. Users should have the option to control their data and delete it as desired. Additionally, transparency regarding how data is being used and who has access to it is crucial.

It is worth noting that AI-powered tools have the potential to deliver significant benefits, from enhanced customer experiences to improved efficiency. However, to fully realize these benefits, users must have trust in the platforms they use and confidence that their data is being used ethically and responsibly.

A best practice that I can recommend when using these (or any other) online services is to review the privacy policy and terms of service before uploading any content. Only with a real understanding of what the services are going to do with our content, will we be able to make the correct decision or to refuse to use the platform.

In conclusion, as AI-powered tools become more prevalent, it is essential to be mindful of the privacy implications of using web services that provide these tools. By selecting services with strong data protection policies and transparency measures, users can enjoy the benefits of AI-powered tools while maintaining control over their personal information.
