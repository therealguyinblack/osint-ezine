# 202404\_01\_Biometrics-Blockchain-and-AI

I was researching and documenting myself for an incoming article about VPNs and how they will be banned very soon (stay tuned) when a [post](https://t.me/toncoin/1245) crossed my path and I dive into the rabbit hole. [TON Society](https://ton.org/), the blockchain based on Telegram, has partnered with an AI company called [HumanCode](https://humancodeai.com/#/main) to offer... _proof-of-personhood_ based on cutting-edge palm scanning technology.

I've previously highlighted the risks associated with biometric solutions in this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7171064835294642176-PsT8/). Yet, my experience tells me that this is going to be a new trend and a new attack vector: biometric solutions based on blockchain and AI technologies.

<br>

**Why Biometrics Matter**

Biometric data, the most intimate and personal information we possess, defies replication. Unlike passwords or two-factor devices, the contours of our irises or the unique patterns on our palms are inherently ours. They identify us unequivocally.

**TON Society's Big Bet**

**TON Society's** allocated a staggering 1 million Toncoin (equivalent to over 5 million dollars) to **HumanCode**. Together, they aim to fortify the TON blockchain with robust identity verification mechanisms based on palm face scanning. Their ultimate goal? To validate the authenticity of social network users, a noble quest in the battle against bot hordes.

However, as someone who once scrutinized the [**Worldcoin**](https://worldcoin.org/) project, I can't help but feel a shiver when I encounter the trifecta of "_biometrics, blockchain, and AI_" It's a potent mix, one that promises security but also raises red flags.

**Navigating the Risks**

No system is infallible. Weekly there is a new leak, ransomware campaign or attack stealing data from users. Biometric solutions so far rely on visual recognition, that means that optical devices such as cameras need to take a picture/video from us and then, compare it against its authentication systems. The process of taking a picture or storing such a vital and personal piece of information, our biometric data, opens a new world of attacks that will push impersonation and deepfakes to new limits.

Sadly I cannot share at this point more about deepfakes and these biometric solutions to achieve _proof-of-personhood_. I am finishing my new presentation on the topic that will unveil a new point of view about the matter and will make audiences to consider seriously the risk that these technologies pose.

Stay safe, your biometric data is your most precious data.
